A SUBTLE GAME ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ....................\n15 INTRODUCTION\nBy Theo. Annemann\nCLOSE to a year ago, there made its appearance upon the horizon of magi cdom a book.\nBut what a book! Not for many a moon had the production of a tome related to magic\nstirred the hearts and emotions of those addicted to the reading, collecting, and\nperformance of things magical, especially tricks with cards.\nThe book, aptly named an 'Encyclopedia' contained between its covers nearly every\npractical card trick produced, invented and improved by magical students for forty years\nor more. The combined value of its contents, were the tricks to be computed at their\noriginal markete d price, was well over one thousand dollars. And were one to sit well\nback and mull over the countless hours of study, concentration, and brain -wrecking\nperiods of mind fixation necessary to produce the contents, it would stagger the best of\nimaginations.\nThe material included in the volume was compiled by Doctor Wilhelm Von Deusen in\ncollaboration with Mr. Glenn G. Gravatt, the latter a devout follower of magic for many\nyears and an erstwhile contributor to magical journals. The magic fraternity knows lit tle\nor nothing concerning Doctor Von Deusen who must have spent years in gathering this\nhuge collection of secrets which embraced the original ideas and inventions of the world's\nbest card men.\nAs originally produced the book was mimeographed on large pag es, the over -all size of\nthe volume making it quite bulky for the average bookcase. These are not the\nqualifications generally expected and desired in a work of this character. However,\ndespite its format, the book was an immediate success because of its c ontents which\nmade the work one of the most valuable to appear in years. The original price was Ten\nDollars at which figure Mr. Gravatt reports that over eight hundred copies were sold,\ncompletely exhausting his one and only edition.\nThe demand for a seco nd edition became so insistent that Mr. Max Holden undertook the\nmonumental job. In the belief that such valuable material warranted the best possible\ntreatment he has produced herein a beautifully printed and bound book of a size and\nmakeup to be respecte d on any shelf. Together with its secrets it now stands alone as\nundoubtedly the greatest and most complete Encyclopedia of Card Tricks ever conceived.\nProduced at a cost of over two thousand dollars, the original work has been entirely\nrewritten by Mr. J ean Hugard, whose many magical publications are but scant evidence\nof his mastery in all phases and departments of magical knowledge.\nMr. Hugard tested every trick herein before placing it on paper. Where, as was the case\nquite often, the original work de leted, (through translation, no doubt) or skipped over\n16 important details necessary for correct performance, Mr. Hugard discovered these\nmissing points, and corrected the faults.\nAt half the price of the Gravatt publication, this book contains even more tr icks!\nImprovements, variations, and other effects of a nature that need little mechanical ability\nhave been added. Intricate sleight -of-hand tricks and those requiring much practice have\nbeen left out of this boon to card trick lovers. There is a mystery f or every condition,\nplace or time. The owner and reader of what is within these covers need never be at a\nmoment's loss for a trick.\nBut Mr. Holden has gone still further in his zeal to promote good will and avoid any\npossible criticism on the part of tho se who originated the tricks incorporated in this\nrevised edition.\nBefore starting on the task of putting the book into printed form, Mr. Holden approached\nall known originators of the effects herein, and secured written permission from each for\nthe inclu sion of the tricks. Days were spent in the checking of books, magazines, and\nwriting to authorities on magic in order to trace the ownership of certain effects.\nFor magic is a strange and inconsistent profession when it comes to inventing a new trick.\nNew principles are few and very far between. One man invents a trick. He thinks of and\nputs into practice an effect which is different than any before, and uses it with great\nsuccess and acclaim. But that trick, to which he has a just claim, may depend entire ly\nupon principles conceived years ago by as many as four or five different people! A\nmagician who 'steals' the effect of another always falls back on the excuse that the\nprinciple is an old one and available to everyone, notwithstanding that the individua l\nfrom whom the effect has been appropriated conceived an entirely new and novel\napplication of that old principle. The argument, to date, has been endless, and so many\ninventors add a new twist or kink to a trick and pass it on to another who does the sam e,\nthat it is understandable why a trick can reach a state of near perfection and have so many\nwho claim it as their own. And each one claims it because of his particular addition in the\nform of a move, twist or manner of presentation, despite the fact tha t he had a nucleus\nupon which to work, and regardless of the fact that several more constructive ideas have\nbeen added by others.\nSo, within the present volume, Mr. Holden has given credit by name to those who\nbrought the effects described into the limeli ght through twists and fancies of their own,\nand marketed them to the profession. Thanks for such permission are due Percy Abbott,\nHoward Albright, Al Baker, Frank Chapman, Charles Eastman, U. F. Grant, Leslie Guest,\nRalph W. Hull, Geo. Johnson, Charles T. Jordan, Frank Lane, William W. Larsen, Loyd\nof California, Charles W. Nyquist, J. F. Orrin, Ralph W. Read, John Scarne, Floyd G.\nThayer, Dai Vernon, Herman Weber and M. F. Zens. Special thanks are due Harry Leat\ntoo, for the publication within of a comple te work, \"The Nikola Card System,\" now out\nof print, and for which many have paid almost half the cost of this entire volume.\n17 Program after program may be built from the contents of this encyclopedia, and it is\ndoubtful if the day will come when the trick s herein will not be useful. It is hardly\nprobable that this generation of magicians and card trick fans will again see the like of the\nrevised \"Encyclopedia of Card Tricks.\"\nNew York City June, 1\n\nMiscellaneous Impromptu Card Tricks"

    "text": "This effective trick can be done with any pack of cards. Begin by having the deck\nshuffled by a spectator. In taking it back sight the bottom card, make an overhand shuffle,\nbringing it to the top and note also the bottom card at the end of the shuf fle. Go to a lady\nand say you will make a prediction foretelling exactly what she is about to do. Write on a\nslip of paper, \"The gentleman will get the ................ of .................\" filling in with the\nname of the top card of the deck. Fold the sl ip and put it on the table under a glass or\nsome other object. Hand the pack to the lady and ask her to think of a number, then when\nyour back is turned, to deal that number of cards face down on the table, turn the top card\nof those dealt, note what it is , replace the packet on the pack and make one complete cut\nburying the chosen card in the middle. Turn away while the lady does this.\nWhen she is ready, turn again and take the pack. Go to a gentleman and under pretence of\nfixing on a suitable card to imp ress on his mind, run over the faces of the cards, find the\nformer bottom card and cut at that point. Note the card thus brought to the top. On a\nsecond slip write, \"The lady will get the ................ of ...............\" fill in the name of this\ntop ca rd. Fold the slip and put it with the first. Ask the lady to whisper the number she\nchose to the gentleman. Hand the pack to him and tell him to deal the cards face down\nand note the card at that number. This done, reassemble the pack and shuffle it as you\nbuild up the effect by recapitulating what has been done. Hand out the slips in the reverse\norder to that in which you wrote them. Have the two cards named, then have the slips\nopened and read, proving that you predicted the choice of those very cards.\n19 THE MAGIC BREATH\nThis is a good example of how the presentation can be made to transform a simple trick\ninto a striking effect. The trick is that in which a card is sent to any number chosen by the\nspectator, the first time the cards are counted a wrong ca rd appears but on a second count\nthe right one turns up. The method is simplicity itself. The card is on the top so that the\nfirst count brings it to the number required so when the packet is replaced on the pack\nand again counted it is found at the correc t number. In the older method the cards were\nreplaced on the pretext of a miscount, a very weak procedure.\nA card having been freely chosen, noted, replaced and brought to the top, execute several\nshuffles keeping it there. Addressing the spectator you sa y, \"Have you a magic breath?\nWell I will show you how to find out. If you have you can send your card to whatever\nposition you please merely by breathing gently on the cards. Will you choose a number?\nNine? Then just blow on the pack and think intently of that number as you blow.\"\nSpectator blows, turn your head away with a slight grimace. \"Your breath does not seem\nto be very magical, but I may be mistaken. Will you take the pack and count down to\nyour number?\"\nHe does this and turns a wrong card. Take th e pack, put the packet counted on top and\nexecute a false shuffle; take the card he turned up and push it in somewhere amongst the\ntop eight cards. \"I knew you would fail,\" you say, \"instead of thinking while blowing,\nyou blew while thinking, not the same thing at all. Let me show you a real magic breath.\nSee, just a gentle zephyr, but it has sent your card to the number required. What was it\nyou chose? Nine?\" Deal 8 cards, have the spectator name his card and turn the ninth.\nThe testing of the spectator's breath can be done delicately or broadly according to the\ntype of audience."

    "text": "Using any deck, the Joker is first placed face up and a spectator is asked to shuffle the\ncards, then take out any face down card and without looking at it put it in his inside coat\npocket with its back outwards. This done he passes the pack to a second person who does\nthe same thing. The process is repeated with a third and fourth person. Thus four cards\nhave been selected at random and even the spectators who have them in their pockets do\nnot know what cards they are. You take the pack, remove the Joker and touching it to\neach person's pocket you call the names of the cards correctly.\nTo do this take the face down pack, spread it t o find the face up Joker, cut to bring it to\nthe top. Make a double lift taking the next face down card with the Joker and holding the\ntwo as one. Keep the Joker with its face squarely to the front and as you go to the first\nspectator sight the index of th e card behind the Joker. Touch the Joker to his pocket and\nslowly tell the value of the card just sighted, then to get the suit insert the Joker in his\npocket, drop the card from behind it and pick up in its place the card that was in the\npocket. Take care to get it squarely behind before removing the Joker. Now name the\nsuit. Spectator takes the card from his pocket and shows it. You sight the index of the\nnew card behind the Joker and repeat the process. Always name either the suit or the\ncolor before ins erting the Joker in the pocket.\nNO. 2. In this method the rather awkward business of changing the cards in the pocket is\navoided. After taking the pack to remove the Joker, run over the cards till you reach it,\nthen reverse it and apparently take it out a nd put it face down on the table, really draw out\nthe card next to it which may be any card at all. Cut the pack to bring the Joker to the top\nand keep the pack in your left hand. Pick up the card from the table sighting it. Insert it in\nthe first person's pocket, calling its name and leave it there, bringing out the card\noriginally placed in the pocket. Proceed in exactly the same way with all the others.\nFinally as the cards are being verified you have ample opportunity to put the last card left\nin your h and on the bottom of the pack and take off the Joker which you throw face up on\nthe table.\nNO. 3. This is an adaptation of \"The Whispering Queen\" (p. 24).\nUsing any pack that has a Joker, have it shuffled by a spectator. Take it and in removing\nthe Joker sight and memorize the 2nd, 3rd, and 4th cards from the bottom. Invite a\nspectator to cut about the middle, put the packets on the table and place his hands on top\nof them. Tell him to lift one hand. If he lifts the hand from the original bottom half of t he\ndeck you say, \"You want to use this packet? Very well.\" Hand it to him and put the other\naside. But if he raises the other hand simply remove that packet and let him retain the one\nunder his hand. Give any plausible reason that occurs to you and have hi m count the\n21 cards face down. Whatever the number may be you say, \"That's fine. I think we'll\nsucceed. Tell him to take off the top card and put it in the middle, do the same with the\nbottom card, and put the next card in his pocket without looking at it. T he next two cards\nare put in the pockets of two other persons, also without being looked at. Now since these\nthree cards are the ones you memorized you have no difficulty in naming them,\npretending, of course, to get the information from the Joker which yo u insert in the\npockets and study carefully each time.\nNO. 4. In this method four cards are freely selected and placed in spectator's pocket\nwithout being looked at as in the first method, but in putting the pack aside you must note\nthe bottom card and re ally take the Joker only in your hand. Suppose the bottom card is\nthe 7S. Advance to the first person, touch the Joker to the outside of his pocket and\nslowly name the color and value of the bottom card of the deck, in this case the 7S. To\nget the shape of the pips you say direct contact must be made. Insert the Joker, drop it and\nseize the card already in the pocket. Now name the suit S., and bring out the card holding\nit face down. Tell the spectator to leave his card as it is till you come back to him. A s you\ngo to the second person tilt the card in your hand a little and sight the outer index. Go\nthrough exactly the same process, naming the card in your hand and exchanging it for the\none in the pocket. Same with the third and fourth spectators. You will have to remember\nthese cards and their order.\nFinally put the supposed Joker, really the card from the fourth person's pocket, face down\non the table and have the first person take out his card without looking at it and put it face\ndown on the supposed Jo ker. Drop the rest of the pack on top. Lift the pack with your left\nhand by the sides as you say \"Yours was the only card I am doubtful about.\" Bend your\nhead down pretending to listen, then say \"Yes I was right it is the 7. S.\" With the tip of\nthe left 3r d finger draw back the bottom card and with the right hand pull out the next, the\nJoker, throwing it face up on the table, and next the 7. S. Pick up the Joker and with it\ntouch the spectators' pockets, again name the three cards. They are taken out and ve rified."

Riffle shuffle, retaining the\nfour top cards in the same position. Put the pack on the table and ask the sp ectator to cut\nit into two packets. Say that you will \"take\" one packet and invite him to touch one. If he\ntouches the original lower portion of the pack, take it and put it aside: if he touches the\noriginal top portion tell him to take it. In any case tha t is the packet he must get.\nInstruct him to take the top card of this packet and push it into the middle, the same with\nthe bottom card, then to take the top card and put it face down on the table and hand the\nsecond and third cards to two other spectato rs. Now proceed to reveal the cards by mind\nreading, pulse reading or any other way that pleases your fancy.\n22 CARDS OF CHANCE\nIn this trick a special move is necessary that is not at all difficult. It is to apparently show\nthe faces of all the cards but t o keep one hidden. You have the card on the top, turn pack\nface outwards and run the cards off one by one from the left hand into the right. When\nyou are about two -thirds through separate the hands for a moment and spread the cards\nremaining in the left ha nd to show the indices at the same time pushing the lowest card,\nthe top card of the deck and the one to be concealed, a little forward behind the others.\nBring the hands together and as you take off the face card of the left hand packet pull off\nthe top c ard behind those in the right hand with the right fingers. Then show all the rest of\nthe cards.\nYou have a deck shuffled by a spectator and in taking it back sight the bottom card, the n\noverhand shuffle it to the top. Suppose it is the 10 spades. Cut, bri nging it to the middle,\nkeeping the tip of the little finger on the 10S. On a slip of paper write 10S. and put it face\ndown on the table without showing what you have written. Ask a spectator to point to a\ncard and contrive to have the 10S. in position as he points. Take the card out and put it\nface down on the table. Ask him to call the name of any card. Suppose he names the 2D.\nHand him a slip of paper and have him write that and put the slip on the table. As he does\nso find the 2D. and slip it to the top . Run over the faces of the cards and show the card is\nnot in the pack. Go to a second person and force the 2D just as you forced the 10S. He\nnames we will say, the AH. Put the 2D down and as he writes AH on a third slip find that\ncard, slip it to the top and show it is not in the pack, using the move explained. Finally\nforce the AH. on a third person and place it on the table opposite your first slip, calling it\nthe 10S. Have the pack examined, the three cards named are not in it. Gather up the three\ncards , mixing them, then match them with the three slips.\nPUSH"

As he tells this, the performer tears the card into a number\nof pieces with the face of the card towards the audience. Then into the dream comes a\ngreat doctor who covers him with a white sheet, but before anything else can happen, the\nman wakes up and finds himself still in the hospital, perfectly well except for the missing\nleg. The corner is then matched to the card by the spectator who identifies his initials.\nMETHOD: —Before starting take the 6, 7, and 8 spots of each suit and put them on the\ntop in any order. Thus the selection must be from one of these cards. Tak e the card out\nand, while the spectator initials it, pick up the pack and the cards dealt, pick out a card of\nthe same suit and put it on the bottom. If the chosen card is a 6, you pick a 7, if it is a 7,\npick a 6 and if an 8 take a 7. Suppose the 7 C. is the card selected, put the 6 C. on the face\nof the deck and cut same into two parts. Take back the 7 C., pick up the original bottom\nhalf of the deck and put the 7 C. at the bottom, i. e. over the 6 C., then slide the two cards\ntogether about an inch over the end of the deck that is opposite the odd spot of the 7 C.\nHold the deck now with its face to the audience, the protruding card seemingly the 7 C.\nonly. Place the remaining half of the deck in front, timing the patter about the man going\ninto the hospit al. Holding the deck firmly, deliberately tear off the index corner of both\ncards as one. Push out the 7 corner with the thumb and hand it to the spectator, then drop\nthe other corner in your pocket as you take out a rubber band.\nTurn the pack face down a nd apparently withdraw the 7 C. but with the left forefinger\npush this card back flush with the deck and draw out the 6 C. face down and put it on the\ntable. Put the rubber band round the pack and hand it to the spectator. Pick up the card\nwith the fingers covering the missing spot and index corner. As you continue relating the\ndream, tear it in half, placing the torn corner half in front. Now very openly tear the card\nseveral times. It is only necessary to vanish the pieces and the sheet in the dream is\nrepresented by your handkerchief which has a dummy packet in one corner. Throw the\nhandkerchief over the pieces and give them to the spectator to hold. Really he gets the\ndummy packet and you pocket the pieces. Tell the ending of the dream, shake out the\nhandkerchief, the pieces have gone. Riffl e the deck at the corner, with the band still round\nit, stopping at the break and have the spectator remove the restored and marked card from\nthe hospital for identification of the initials and the matching of the corn er."

He points to any card he pleases, and that card is removed\nfrom the pack and kept in full view. Next he is asked to think of a card. He nam es it and\nthat card is missing from the deck. He himself turns over the card he pointed out, it is the\ncard he thought of.\nSECRET: —The trick is hardly as good as its sales talk but can be made effective. When\nthe spectator points out a card you pick it up and place it in your outside coat pocket at\nthe top, allowing about half the card to protrude, \"in order to keep it in sight the whole\ntime,\" as you say. As soon as he names the card he has mentally selected, pick up the\npack, run through the faces quickl y and on coming to that card transfer it to the top. Say\nthat you cannot find it and ask the spectator to go through the pack to verify the fact that\nthe card is missing. Palm the top card in your right hand and give him the pack. He also\nfails to find the \"thought\" card. With your right hand apparently take the card from your\ncoat pocket and put it face down on the table, it is the card. What you really do is to push\nthe card in the pocket right down out of sight and insert the palmed card, bringing it out\nin place of the other.\nThe following description of the effect of a trick by Robert Houdin in his book \"Les\nSecrets,\" published in 1868 will be found interesting. \"To place the first card that comes\nto hand on a table and to predict that whatever may be the card another spectator may\nplease to think of such card shall be identical in suit and value with the card previously\nremoved.\"\nThe modern inventor puts the card in his pocket instead of on the table and calls it a new\ntrick."

    "text": "The following fiv e cards are placed face up in an even row on the table, K.H., 7C., A.D.\n4H. and 9D. The performer addresses a spectator, somewhat as follows: —\"I have picked\nout five cards at random and I want you to mentally select just one. You have an\nunrestricted choic e and you must not think that I am trying to influence you in any way.\nFor instance, here is an ace, occupying the central position; you may think of it, and again\nyou may not. Perhaps you think I had a motive in placing just one black card among the\ncards . This might influence your choice, or again it might not. At any rate look over the\nfive cards carefully, as long as you wish, but rest assured that whatever card you\ndefinitely decide upon I shall presently place face down upon your hand and, when you\nyourself are holding the card, I shall ask you to name your card. It will be your card.\nEven when the card is on your hand you have the privilege of changing your mind, still\nthe card will be the one thought of.\"\nWhen the spectator has made his mental choic e, pick up the five cards, mix them, draw\nout the 4H. and put it on his hand face down. He names his card, it is almost inevitably\nthe 4H. The trick is a purely psychological one. The spectator rejects the Ace and the\nKing as being too conspicuous, the 7C. is the one black card and anyway 7 has become\nan overworked number in such tricks, the 9D. is never chosen being widely considered an\nunlucky card, and this reasoning leaves one card only, the 4H. Your patter must be\ndirected towards making the spectator consider each card and form a reason for rejecting\nor choosing it; if you allow a snap choice the trick is almost certain to fail.\nUntil you have had some experience with the effect instead of putting the 4H. on the\nspectator's hand, simply lay 5 cards in a pile with the 4H. on the top and K.H. at the\nbottom. Then if the K.H. is named simply turn the packet over.\n31 \"JUST THINK\" MENTAL MYSTERY\nAsk someone to just think of a card as he shuffles the deck. He may change his mind as\noften as he pleases but, hav ing fixed on one card, he must keep to it. Next take a blank\ncard about the size of a playing card, draw four lines across it, making five spaces, the\nfirst, third and fifth spaces somewhat larger than the second and fourth. Hand this with a\npencil to the spectator asking him to fill in the spaces with the names of four indifferent\ncards and his card in any order he pleases. You address him somewhat after this manner:\n\"You may write the cards in any order. Your mentally selected card can be written in any\nspace you see fit. You may write your card in the first space, or the last or again in the\nmiddle, but don't let me influence your choice of space as this is entirely up to you.\"\nAlmost invariably the thought card will be written in the second space, or, if not there, in\nthe third space. However, you have a second string to your bow by watching his manner\nof writing. You should stand at some little distance from him since you need only watch\nhis hand. There will always be a little hesitation in the writing o f the four cards but, when\nhe writes the name of his mentally selected card he writes it in rapidly.\nThis having been done, take back the pack and the list, glance at the name of the card in\nthe space you have decided on and throw the list face down on the table. Run through the\ndeck, take out the card and put it face down on the table. Give the spectator the list asking\nhim to cross out the indifferent cards, then turn the card you put out. With very little\nexperiences with the feat you should get the card every time. The impression left on the\nspectator's mind is that you picked the card from the whole p ack."

The remaining cards are also shuffled\nby a spectator and from them he takes any card and first calls its suit only. Instantly the\nperformer brings out a card of that suit from his pocket. Next the value of the ca rd is\ncalled and the performer brings out in rapid succession two or more cards whose spots\nadded together make the same value.\nSECRET: —As with so many good tricks this is simple. It was first sold by Jordan some\n20 years ago.\nUnder cover of searching fo r the Joker you find and bring to the face of the deck an Ace,\na Two, a Four and an Eight, each of a different suit. These may be in any order but\nwhatever it is it must be remembered. To avoid this memorizing you may use four set\ncards, say AC, 2H, 4S, an d 8D, and get them to the bottom in that order. Discard the\nJoker and have a spectator cut a packet from the top and shuffle it. While he does this\nseparate the four special cards at the bottom of the remainder of the pack, and hold the\ndivision at the inn er end with the right thumb. Take the shuffled packet back in your left\nhand and bring the right hand packet over it for a moment as you turn to the left to hand\nthis packet to a spectator to hold. In that moment drop the four separated cards on top of\nthe shuffled packet in the left hand. Quietly and smoothly done, without any snatching\nmotion the action will never be noticed. Hand the right hand packet to a spectator and put\nthe left hand packet in your inner breast pocket.\nKnowing the suit and value of each of the four top cards you can now match suit and\nvalue with any card called, by bringing out the card of the right suit first, then one, two or\nthree cards to make up the value. If the card brought out to show the suit is needed in the\nvalue combinati on simply count it first and follow with the other card or cards from the\npocket.\n36 In a version of the effect by Albright the AS. and 2H. are put in the right coat pocket, the\n4D. and 8C. in the left pocket. A spectator shuffles and cuts the pack in half, retaining\none half. You take the other half and divide it in half, placing one half in each of the two\npockets, and immediately removing them together with the cards already in the pockets\nwhich are then examined to prove the absence of any apparatus. The trick then proceeds\nas an example of sensitive finger tips, the required cards being produced from either\npocket as required.\nProbably the simplest way to do the trick is to seize an opportunity during a previous\ntrick to get the four necessary cards toge ther. When ready to do the trick you have merely\nto look through the pack for the Joker and casually cut the cards bringing the four to the\nbottom. Riffle shuffle several times, always letting four or more cards fall first from the\nleft hand, square the de ck and have a spectator cut off about half the cards and retain\nthem. The other packet you place in your pocket and proceed as usual, drawing the cards\nas required from the bottom.\nTHE CARD MIRACLE —CERTAIN\nThe principle upon which the following tricks de pend first appeared in print in the \"Art of\nMagic\" in 1909 (See p. 137), as set forth therein \"the secret lies in locating the selected\ncard by observing where the spectator breaks the pack.\" That is to say, when a spectator\ncuts the deck you estimate how many cards are in the lower packet. If you have\nbeforehand sighted the bottom card it follows that, no matter how many complete cuts\nhave been made, if you again cut it to bring the sighted card to the bottom, you can divide\nthe pack within a card or two o f the spectator's original cut. How close you come to it\nwill depend on the accuracy of your estimate. A few trials will show that the principle is\nnot really difficult, particularly since all that is necessary is to come within a few cards of\nthe right sp ot.\n1. Tucker's Version.\nAny pack of cards shuffled by spectator, the bottom card sighted and the pack placed on\nthe table. A spectator cuts freely and notes the bottom card of the packet cut, then\nreplaces the cards, squares the pack and makes as many co mplete cuts as he pleases. Take\nthe deck, run over the faces and find the key card. Supposing you estimated that there\nwere 20 cards in the bottom heap after the first cut, then cut the pack two cards below the\nkey and place these 18 cards on the top. Put the next two cards from the bottom onto the\ntop taking a mental note of what cards they are. The two shifts of the 18 cards and the\ncards from the bottom to the top are done under cover of the movements of running the\ncards fanwise as you pretend to sear ch for the chosen card. Finally palm the bottom six\ncards in your left hand (Erdnase, p. 86).\nYou now control 8 cards, two known cards on the top of the pack and six cards palmed in\nthe left hand. The chosen card is named: —If it is the top card turn it ov er; if the second\nmake a double lift and show it. If neither of these is the correct card you say, \"Why that\ncard has been in my pocket all evening,\" and reach into your inside coat pocket with the\n37 left hand to produce the card. Turn your right side a litt le to the front with the right hand\nassisting by holding open the coat, and under cover of this action spread the six palmed\ncards so that you can retain the one named and let the others fall into the pocket. It would\nbe very poor estimate that failed to g et within 8 cards of the original cut.\n2. Abbott's version. \"The Certain Card Trick.\"\nFor this version only 48 cards are used. Ask a spectator to shuffle and then cut the pack.\nPerformer meanwhile has an opportunity of glancing at the card on the bottom o f the\npack. Spectator is asked to hold the pack and peek at one card. Performer merely\nestimates the number of cards raised. He may lift 12 cards and your guess is 13, or again\nyou may guess 16. In either case, divide your guess by 6; for instance 6 into 1 3 is 2 and\none over, or 6 into 16 is 2 and 4 over. Discard the number over. Spectator is directed to\ncut the pack as many times as he wishes, then to lay the cards, one at a time, face up, on\nthe table (dealing from the top of the pack). When he has laid o ut a row of 6 cards, from\nleft to right he is directed to lay out another row underneath until he has 6 rows of eight\ncards in a row.\nNote the key card which is the card that you glimpsed at on the bottom of the pack. Note\nthe row it is in. Suppose the ke y card is the Jack of Clubs and it is in the fourth row and\nthe fourth card down, and the number of cards that you guessed was 16 which as\nexplained above gives you 2. Add this 2 to 4 which totals 6. Spectator is now asked\nwhich row his card is in. If his card is in the same row as your key card then his card is\nthe sixth card down from the top. If it is in a row to the right of your key card, then his\ncard is the sixth card down in that row. If his card is in a row to the left of your key card\nrow, add 1 t o 6 and his card must be the seventh card down. Should your number be more\nthan 8 continue the count at the top again.\n3. The Nelson Downs Original.\nAs worked by Mr. Downs: after locating the original bottom card, he cut the pack one\ncard below it, palmed three cards off the bottom in his left hand and put the next card on\ntop, sighting all five so that when the chosen card was named he knew whether to turn the\ntop card, show the bottom card or pretend to draw the card from his pocket.\nThe trick can be done without resorting to sleight of hand. Suppose the spectator cuts, as\nhappens most often, within a card or two of the center. When you take the pack back run\nthrough it with the faces towards yourself and find the key card. Cut the cards bringing\nthe key card to the bottom, restoring the pack to the same order as when the spectator\nmade his selection. Count to the 23rd card from the bottom and shift t hem to the top.\nGlance at the indices of the next five cards, the original 24th, 25th, 26th, 27th and 28th\ncards, and memorize them, put one card out on the table face down, and the next two on\nthe top, remembering the positions. Have the card named: if it is the one face down on\nthe table, simply turn it triumphantly; if it is the top card, drop the pack without remark\non the table card and turn the top card; if it is second from the top make a double lift; if it\nis the bottom card, turn the pack over and show it and if it is the one next the bottom\n38 simply lift the pack, keeping it face down, draw back the bottom card, and pull out the\nnext one.\nA good variation is to sight the top card when laying the pack on the table for the\nspectator to cut, then when he has cut —looked at card and replaced the cut, let him draw\nout the bottom card and bury it in the pack. This will eliminate any suspicion that the\nbottom card is being used as a key, a stratagem that has become rather widely known\neven amongst laymen."

    "text": "1.—The method, given in the original type -script Encyclopedia, for arranging any desired\nspelling combination, was very laborious and uncertain: it was simply that of working the\ncombination backwards. The following is a much better and absolutely sure met hod\nwhereby any arrangement can be worked out quickly and easily. Suppose for example,\nyou desire to get the formula for spelling the cards of one suit from the Ace to the King,\none card to be put from the top to the bottom of the packet for each letter, a nd the card\nspelled to be turned up following the last letter; take a pencil and paper and mark off\nspaces in a row.\n\nSpell A -C-E, tapping one space for each letter and mark A in the fourth space: spell T -WO, and put 2 in the fourth space following: spell T -H-R-E-E and mark 3 in the sixth space\nfurther on, which will bring you to the first space in the row: spell F -O-U-R and mark\nin the fifth space\n\nfurther on: continue in exactly the same way, counting the empty spaces only, ignoring\nthose filled until you finally write in the King, with the result that the formula will read —\n3, 8, 7, A, Q, 6, 4, 2, J, K, 10, 9,\nwhich will be found to bring about the exact result required.\n41 The same system can be applied to any combination. Another example showing its\napplication to a trick follows —The effect to be brought about is this: from a thoroughly\nshuffled deck the magician takes all the cards of a selected suit, as they lie after the\nshuffle and tells the following story, at each word he puts a card under the packet and\nturns a card whenever its name is mentioned. He says: —\n\"This is the tale of the Jack of Hearts (JH) who stole the tarts, he ate (8) seventy -five (7)\n(5) and was so si ck (6) the King (K) thought he was threatened (3) (10) with appendicitis,\nbut the Queen (Q) at once (A) came to (2) the rescue and by good fortune (4) saved his\nlife; like the cat he had nine (9).\"\nTo arrive at the necessary formula, again mark out 13 spa ces: repeat the story, tapping\none space for each word, and insert the card as each one is named. The first round will fill\nthe 7th space with JH. and the 13th space with the 8: the next round will fill the first\nspace with the 7 and the next with the 5, a nd the 6 will go in the 6th space, ignoring that\nalready filled by the JH.; the next, the K goes into the 9th space, and so on until all the\nspaces are filled and the complete formula runs ——\n7, 5, 3, 10, 9, 6, J, A, K, 4, 2, Q.\nThis will be found to bri ng out the cards correctly.\nTo work the trick, put any 13 cards on top of the Heart suit, arranged according to the\nformula, and place these 26 cards on top of the remainder of the pack. You have a card\nselected, being careful to spread the Hearts only, s ince a Heart must be drawn, and have it\nreturned to the same position, telling the spectator to remember the suit only. Split the\ndeck at the 8H. with the right thumb and riffle shuffle slowly and openly, calling\nattention to the thorough way the cards are being mixed. Square up and again split the\ndeck for another riffle shuffle, this time being careful to see the 7H. fall from the right\nthumb before dividing the deck. Shuffle slowly and openly again. Everyone will be\nconvinced that the cards are hopelessl y mixed; however, the first shuffle merely\ndistributed the Hearts through the lower part of the pack, while the second spread them\nthroughout the whole deck, but in each case the relative positions of the Heart cards\nremain the same —and when the intervenin g cards are eliminated their original order\nremains undisturbed.\nNow inquire what the suit of the chosen card was: the answer being \"Hearts\", you turn\nthe pack face up and take the Hearts out, as they lie, one by one. This process will reverse\ntheir order , so pick up the packet and deal the cards one by one, face down, under\npretence of counting them. The double shuffle, the removal from the pack and the\ncounting will have convinced the spectators that the cards must be in haphazard order and\nthe effect wh en they come out at appropriate times in the telling of the story will be\nsurprising.\n42 As an opening feat for a card routine for small audiences I know of none better. The\nsystem and the principle of the double shuffle were devised by me over thirty years ago\nand they are but little known even yet.\n2—SPELLING A CARD\n(Lawrence Gray —Impromptu)\nThis trick, which was one of the first and is still one of the best of impromptu spelling\ntricks, was not included in the original Encyclopedia although several trick s based on it\nwere.\nA card is forced, or sighted, by the magician. It is replaced in the deck which is shuffled\nby the spectator. Taking the pack, the performer runs through it, face up, to show that the\ncard has not been removed. When he comes to the sel ected card, (say for instance it was\nthe 10C.) he begins to spell its name, TEN -OF-CLUBS, passing one card for each letter,\nand when he arrives at the last letter, S., he inserts the tip of his left little finger above it\nand holds a break at that point, b ut keeps right on running through the deck without\npausing. He cuts the deck at the break and hands it to the spectator, instructing him to\nspell the name of his card, dealing one card for each letter and turning up the last card so\ndealt. The spectator do es this and, of course, finds his own card.\nInstead of forcing a card, the bottom card of the pack may be sighted and when the pack\nis divided for the return of the chosen card, this is done by an under cut, so that the\nsighted card is brought above it. A casual overhand shuffle will not separate the two\ncards. When running over the faces of the cards the performer has simply to watch for the\nsighted card and start his spelling on the next. It sometimes happens that the card does\nnot show up until there ar e not enough cards above it for the spelling, in that case stop\nwhen there are only about 10 cards to be run over, cut the pack and start again from the\nface card. The trick bears repetition.\n3.—DUPLEX COMEDY SPELLER\n(Larry Gray —Any Deck)\nAny deck is tho roughly shuffled by spectator; take it back sighting the bottom card.\nSpread the cards and allow a free choice. Undercut half the deck for the replacement of\nthe card, thus bringing the key card on top of the chosen one. Cut several times, or a short\noverh and shuffle may be made with little risk of separating the two cards. To show that\nthe card has not been removed or tampered with, run the cards over before the spectator\nin an even tempo, telling him to see that his card is still there but not to indicate what or\nwhere it is. You watch for the key card, when you reach it, begin to spell its name,\nstarting with it and counting mentally one card for each letter. On reaching the last letter,\nask, \"Have you seen your card?\" and separate your hands slightly. Th e answer will be\n\"Yes.\" Bring your hands together reversing the position of the cards they held. The key\ncard is thus set for spelling from the top of the deck, and the chosen card lies under it.\n43 Now illustrate the trick by naming, apparently at random th e key card and spell it, turning\nit up on the last letter and showing it. The chosen card is now on top of the pack which\nyou hand to the spectator to spell out his card, of course he fails, but in dealing the cards\nhe has put his card in correct position to be spelled. So when you replace the packet on\nthe pack and tell him the mystic word to use, he succeeds in spelling this card.\nThis is one of the best of the Impromptu spelling tricks.\n4.—FARELLI'S IMPROMPTU SPELLER\n(Gray's Speller —Single Card)\nForce a card and allow the spectator to replace it in the pack and thoroughly shuffle. Take\nthe pack face upwards in the left hand and deal the cards face down on the table, letting\nthe spectator see the face of each card as you deal. When you reach the forced card spell\nit in, beginning with the card itself, including the 'of and on reaching the last letter\nhesitate and ask the spectator if you have passed his card. The answer is of course \"Yes.\"\nTurn the cards in your left hand face down, pick up the packet fr om the table and put\nthem on top. If possible use a false shuffle and series of false cuts, then spell out the card\nturning it up on the last letter.\nInstead of forcing a card, the chosen card may be sighted after its return to the deck, or a\nkey card may be used, the card being replaced next to it and so located when the cards are\ndealt.\n5.-KNOCK OUT SPELLER\nNo preparation\nEFFECT: —Any pack shuffled freely and spread on the table, a spectator removes any\ncard he wishes, looks at it and replaces it at th e spot from which he took it. Magician\ngathers up the deck, the card is named and he spells it out, dealing a card to each letter,\nfinally turning up the card.\nSECRET: —When the deck is spread on the table it must be done with a wide sweep. The\nspectator is given a free choice but when he removes a card, count visually to the 12th\ncard above the spot from which it was removed. When the card is replaced, watch the\ncard to which you counted, and in gathering up the pack hold a break there with the\nthumb and transfer them to the bottom by cutting the deck. The chosen card will now be\nthe 13th card and most cards can be spelled with 13 letters. If it is necessary to ge t rid of\none or two cards simply take them off the top, fan the deck with them and then put them\ncasually on the bottom. The best way to pick up the cards is to first make the spread from\nright to left, then when a card has been removed, pick up the cards above the 12th card\nbeyond it and use them as a scoop to pick up the rest when the card has been returned.\n44 6.—A SINGLE SPELLER\nImpromptu —4 piles of\nAny deck shuffled by spectators and dealt into four piles of thirteen cards each.\nAny card selected i n any heap is noted, and put on top of any one of the piles. Drop one\npile on top of this, pick up the two piles and place the remaining two heaps below the\npacket thus made. The chosen card will, therefore, be the 14th card from the top of the\ndeck. It is necessary to run off one card from the top in the false shuffle and spell the\nselected card with thirteen letter. (See system used in The Double Speller).\n7.—SUPERLATIVE SPELLER\n(Ben Erens —Impromptu)\nEFFECT: —Borrowed deck laid on table and spectator cut s. He chooses either heap, cuts\nthis and looks at the bottom card of the cut. The cut portion is replaced and the deck\nreassembled. The card looked at is named and the magician spells it out, taking off a card\nfor each letter, and at the end of the spellin g shows the card selected.\nSECRET: —When anyone cuts a pack it is usually divided near the center. The deck\nhaving been cut and a pile chosen, invite the spectator to cut that heap and illustrate by\ncutting the remaining pile about the middle. When he does likewise make an estimate of\nthe number he cuts off, usually from ten to fifteen. He then looks at the bottom card of his\ncut and replaces the cards. Pick up this pile and place it on top of the other portion, thus\nreassembling the deck with the selected card at the number from the top as estimated by\nyou.\nFalse shuffles and cuts may follow according to your ability. Have the card named.\nSuppose the 4C is the card, and you estimate it is about 14 cards down. Spell out \"The\nFour of Clubs\" and the card show s up either on the B or the S. In either case act as if that\nwas what you intended. If it doesn't fall at S throw out another card and say \"Four of\",\nand if that is the card say \"Clubs\"; but if not, then throw still another card and with it say\n\"Clubs.\" In other words you fit the spelling to the number of cards you estimate the\nspectator cut. By adding or omitting the \"of\" and the final \"s\" of the suit the spelling can\nbe made flexible enough to fit all cases. With but little practice the number of cards ca n\nbe estimated to within one or two.\n8.—YOU SELECTED THE ——————"

Fan the cards face outwards to show they are well mixed,\nthen have three cards taken from anywhere below th e top ten cards. Undercut about half\nthe deck and have the first spectator return his card on the original top card. Put the cut\non top but hold break with tip of little finger. Go to second spectator, cut at break and\nhave his card reurned on top of the f irst. Do the same with the third person. With the\npass, or by a simple cut at the break bring the three cards to the top with the original stock\nof ten cards below them.\nDemonstrate how to spell a card, naming as if at random the card you originally set t enth\nfrom the top which will spell out correctly due to the three selected cards now on the top\nof the stack.

Hand the deck to the third spectator and he spells\nout his card. Put this on top of the cards ju st spelled off and replace the packet on the top.\nThe three chosen cards are again on top of the deck. Send the top card, that was just\nspelled to the middle by the Slip Cut (Erdnase, p. 39) leaving the other two on the top.\nDramatically turn up the secon d spectator's card, the top one, showing that you have\nmagically cut at that very card. Leave it face up, then pick up the two cards as one, by the\ndouble lift, turn the deck over in the left hand and bury the card (really two cards) also\nface up, somewher e in the middle of the deck. As a result of the double lift the first man's\ncard is now reversed in the deck. Hand the pack to him to hold firmly and build up the\nfinal climax.\n48 13.—THE NEW SPELL\n(Hugard —Impromptu)\nAny pack shuffled and a card freely chos en. In closing the deck secretly reverse the\nbottom card. Undercut about half the cards —have chosen card replaced —drop cut on top,\nand square up very openly. Reversed card is now on top of the chosen card. Overhand\nshuffle with backs of cards towards you a nd when the reversed card shows up give it a\nflick with the left thumb so that it falls to the floor, and drop the cards remaining in right\nhand under those in left. Chosen card is now on top of the pack. Stoop to pick up the\nfallen card and reverse the to p (chosen) card against your left thigh.\nIn order to show, as you say, that the spectator's card is not near the top or the bottom of\nthe deck, hold the cards facing the front and run cards off the bottom into your left hand.\nAs you do so, spell mentally the name of the card taking a card for each letter (you know\nit since it faces you on top of the deck). Pause on the last letter and ask if the card has\nbeen seen. At the answer, \"No,\" drop the remaining cards from the right hand on the face\nof those in th e left hand, thus bringing them above the reversed chosen card and putting it\nin position to be spelled out. Run a few more off the bottom in the same way and again\nask if the card has been seen, and at the same answer \"No,\" put them again on the bottom.\nFan off a few from the top to show that it is not anywhere near the top. These cards have\nbeen already shown but no one ever notices that.\nHand deck to spectator to be held behind his back. Instruct him to spell the name of his\ncard, bringing forward one c ard for each letter, being sure to use the \"of.\" He does this\nand nothing happens but when he brings the deck to the front his card lies reversed on the\ntop of the deck staring him in the face.\n14.—THE AUTOMATIC SPELLER\n(Mihlon Clayton —Impromptu)\nSpectator shuffles his own deck, then turns it and runs over the faces to see that the cards\nare well mixed. You mentally note the bottom card. Instruct him to deal three piles of six\ncards face up on the table If he deals from the bottom of the face up pa ck, dismiss from\nyour mind the card just noted and remember the bottom card of those remaining after the\nheaps have been dealt. These cards are laid aside face down and the bottom card is the\nkey card. If, however, he turns the pack over and deals from the top then the bottom card\nalready noted becomes the key.\nTell spectator to choose one of the piles while your back is turned, turn them all face\ndownwards, take any card from the pile selected, look at it, and put it on top of any of the\nother heaps. He i s then to shuffle the remaining cards of the pile he chose, and place them\non top of his card and, finally, replace the last heap on top of the other two. The resulting\npile is placed on top of the remainder of the deck and a complete cut made.\n49 Now if the deck were again cut to bring the key card to the bottom naturally the chosen\ncard will be the 12th from the top. To bring this about you tell the spectator to deal off\nsome cards face up to show how thoroughly they are mixed. When the key card appears\nyou stop him, as being satisfied he shuffled the pack well, and have him place the cards\njust dealt at the bottom of the pack. The chosen card is now 12th card down and as he is\nto spell it out himself you instruct him how to do it. The majority of the cards spell with\n11 or 12 letters, if with 11 he must turn the next card, if with 12, then on the last letter.\nFor the 3, 7, 8 and Q. of Hearts and Spades tell him to spell the suit first, then value. For\n3, 7, 8 and Q. of Diamonds, spell Diamonds, then value. F or the A., 2, 6 and 10 of Clubs\ntell him to spell \"an\" or \"a\" as required. In other words as you cannot manipulate the\ncards you juggle the spelling.\n15.—SPELLINO\n(U. F. Grant —Impromptu)\nIn this fine trick instead of spelling the name of a card, you spel l the spectator's name, his\ncard appearing on the last letter. The trick can be repeated with as many people as you\nwish.\nAny deck may be used and you have a spectator shuffle it. He selects one, remembering\nat what number it lies from the top. Let us sup pose his name is Smith. Take the pack,\nplace it behind your back and place the bottom card on top, then reverse the 5th card from\nthe bottom, there being five letters in the name Smith. Bring the pack forward and inquire\nwhat number the selected card was f rom the top. Suppose the answer is 6. Deal off six\ncards and show that the card is no longer there. It is the next card since you placed an\nextra card on the top. Replace the cards and cut the pack. Again put the pack behind your\nback saying that you will reverse a card. Now you get ready for a second name, say it is\nSherman, 7 letters, so you reverse the 7th card from the bottom. Bring the pack forward,\nrun through it to the first reversed card, being careful not to expose the second reversed\ncard. Divide the pack at the first reversed card and spell SMITH turning the card on the\nH. It is his card.\nNow step up to Sherman and put the pack on the table and have him cut it in two piles,\nthe top we will call A. and the bottom B. Let him look at the top card of B. place it on A.\nand place B. on top of A. burying his card. Place the pack behind your back to reverse\nanother card. If you intend to repeat the trick with a third person you reverse a card at the\nsame number from the bottom as there are letters in his name. If you finish on the second\nname, simply bring the deck forward and proceed in exactly the same way as you did for\nthe name Smith, that is cut at the reversed card and spell SHERMAN, turning his card on\nthe N. It will be seen that the trick can be re peated ad lib, but three cards are enough.\n16.—SPELLINO CLIMAX\nGrant —Impromptu\n50 Spectator shuffles any deck and hands it to you. Immediately you spell of the names of\ndifferent cards, turning them up correctly on the last card in each case.\nWhen deck is returned sight the top card — Suppose it is the 10S. which spells with\nletters. Think of any other card which also spells with 12 letters, the AH for instance. By\nway of explaining what you are going to do name the AH and spell it out a card for each\nletter without, however, turning the last card. This process places the 10S. in position.\nMake a false cut and then name the 10S: spell it out and turn it up on the last letter. In\npicking up the packet to replace it on top, sight the bottom card, suppose it is the 6D.\nwhich spells with 13 letters. You know it now lies 12th so you need to have one more\ncard above it. If you can execute a simple false shuffle you do it that way running one\ncard first, if not, simply take any card from the middle without lookin g at it. Just do it\ncasually without remark. Now spell the 6D. As before note the bottom card in replacing\nthe packet on top. Calculate the number of cards required to spell it and if it is less than\n13 run off the extra card or cards in the shuffle, or si mply take them off and put them in\nthe middle. In the latter case you should pretend to study them and make an intricate\ncalculation before naming the card you are about to spell.\nThe trick can be repeated ad lib. and even without the false shuffle will b e found\neffective.\n17.—HOWARD'S SIMPLEX SPELLER\n(Albright —Impromptu)\nShuffle any pack of cards and have one freely chosen. While spectator looks at his card,\ncut the deck and slightly squeeze the rear end of the lower half, crimping all the cards of\nthat packet. Cut at this crimp and have the card replaced on that packet and drop the\nupper half on top.\nMake a series of under cuts throwing them on top and finally cut at the crimp, genuinely\nand openly, bringing the chosen card to the top. Have the chosen card named.\nSpell it by taking off one card for each letter with the right hand. The first card will be the\nchosen card so you hold the cards low down and parallel with the table top. Take off the\nsecond card underneath the first and continue in the same way so that the cards in your\nright hand keep the same relative order, that is the chosen card is always on top of the\npacket being counted off. When this card is well covered by others gradually raise your\nhands until the cards in both hands are vertical. When you reach the second last letter of\nthe card's name push the chosen card from the back of the packet in your right hand on to\nthe cards in the left hand with your right thumb, the left thumb immediately drawing it\nback on top of the left hand packet. At the same moment the right hand takes off another\ncard and then on the last letter the card just slid across is taken and shown.\nIt will be seen that this is simply an application of the well -known false count, which, if\nexecuted with proper tempo, is perfectly illusive.\n51 18.—U SPELL YOUR CARD\nImpromptu.\nFrom any deck, freely shuffled, a spectator takes any card he pleases. While he looks at\nit, divide the deck as if about to cut for the replacement of the card, but before separating\nthe hands squeeze the inner end of the bottom packet, bending them to sha pe IT, the outer\nend remaining straight. Now cut and have the chosen card replaced on top of the lower\nbridged portion and drop the other packet openly on top. Make a series of run cuts,\ndropping them on top and finally cut at the bridge, sending the chose n card to the bottom\nand glimpsing it. Make an overhand shuffle and bring the card to the top.\nNow by way of illustrating how you propose to find the chosen card, spell off some other\ncard the name of which spells with the same number of letters. Don't sh ow the last card in\nthis spelling, simply pick up the packet, drop it on top of the pack and spell out the name\nof the chosen card, which you turn up on the last letter. The trick is not effective unless\nthe pack is given a false shuffle after the packet i s dropped on top. It is easy to make a\nriffle shuffle keeping the packet intact but dropping one card from the left hand on top of\nit: get rid of this extra card with the slip cut and you will find the effect greatly enhanced.\n19.—AN EASY SPELLER\nImpromp tu.\nFrom any deck, freely shuffled, a spectator selects any card he pleases.\nHave the card replaced, bring it to the top and false shuffle, leaving it there, and sighting\nit in the process.\nDeal cards on the table face down, mentally spelling the name of the chosen card, a card\nfor each letter. When you reach the last letter deal the next card on top of the others a\nlittle forward and continue doing the same thing with six or seven more cards , so that\nthere will be a step between the first lot of cards dealt, which spell the name of the card,\nand the cards following them.\nCasually pick up the small packet above the step and drop it on top of the deck, then pick\nup the remainder and put them o n top of all. Hand the pack to a spectator, instruct him\nhow to spell the name of his card and deal a card at each letter. He does this and, of\ncourse, turns up his card on the last letter."

Put a short card ninth from the bottom of the\n52 pack. Have the deck thus arranged in its case. When ready take it out and if possible false\nshuffle and cut. Take the first six cards, fan them before a spectator asking him to\nmentally select one card.

Hand five cards\nto each of four persons, asking each one t o merely think of one card and then turn the\npacket face down on his hand: this last to prevent the order from being disturbed. The\npackets may be returned in any order but such order must be remembered: it is best to\nhave the last packet replaced first an d so on, the first packet being replaced last of all.\nShuffle 10 cards on top of the last packet returned and all is set to spell out the first\nperson's card.\nAfter spelling out the first card, replace all the cards on top and in the course of a shuffle\nrun five cards off the top, thus leaving the set -up ready for the spelling of the second\n53 mentally selected card. The same procedure follows for the third and fourth cards. With a\nlittle calculation you can spell the cards out in any desired order after spel ling the first.\nFor instance, suppose number four's card is called for, you shuffle off 15 cards, that is the\nfirst 10 indifferent cards and the five cards of the first set now done with.\n22.—ANOTHER THOUGHT SPELLING\n(Annemann)\nFour sets of four cards ar e prearranged on the top of the deck. The cards in each set must\nspell with 12, 13, 14 and 15 letters respectively. For instance, the first four can be 4H, 7S,\n4D, and QD, the word \"of\" being included with the value and suit of each card. In\narranging each packet of four on top of the deck place them in reverse order so that when\ndealt one card at a time they will be in correct order. At the bottom of the deck have a\nshort.\nTo work the trick, deal off four piles of four cards: let any pile be chosen and ha ve a\nspectator mentally select one card in it. Place this packet on top of the deck and the other\nthree packets on top of that; the addition of these twelve cards ensuring the correct\nspelling of any card of the first packet replaced. Have the deck cut sev eral times and,\nfinally, cutting it yourself at the short card, being careful to carry that card also to the\nbottom. The thought card will come out automatically after the last letter of its name is\nspelled.\nYou, of course, do not know what the card is un til it is named. The short card can be\ndispensed with by noting the bottom card, then after the cutting, fan through the cards\nand cut or make the pass to bring the bottom card back to its original position.\n23.—IMPROVED SPELLING TRICK\n(Kater)\nOn top of the pack place the following six cards: 10C, 6H, KS, 8H, 9D, 3D —these cards\nspell with 10, 11, 12, 13, 14 and 15 letters respectively. Put nine indifferent cards on top\nof these.\nBegin by spreading cards face up to prove they are all different and unprepa red. False\nshuffle and cut, leaving the top 15 cards in position. Fan the deck but expose to the\nspectator's view the six arranged cards only, requesting him to mentally select one card.\nThis done, close the deck, false shuffle and cut as before, and hand the cards to the\nspectator. Instruct him to spell out his card, dealing one card for each letter, and turn up\nthe card on the last letter. He does this and finds his card.\nOf course any other combination of cards that will spell with the same numbers of l etters\ncan be used.\n54 24.—THINK IT ———— SPELL IT\n(8 Card Set -Up)\nArrange the following eight cards in this order: —Joker, 2C, 6H, 9S, QS, 9D, QD, 3D.\nPlace these cards on the top and run 8 cards on them thus making the Joker the ninth\ncard. Spread the cards f or a mental selection of one card by running off the first eight\ncards quickly, then spreading the next eight slowly. Follow with false shuffles and cuts,\nbeing careful not to disarrange the first 16 cards. The card thought of is named and you\nspell it out in the usual way, one card dealt out for each letter in the name, the \"of\" being\nused throughout and the card turned on the last letter, except for the Joker and 3D; for\nthese the card following the last letter card is turned up. Any other cards having th e same\nnumber of letters in their names can be used.\n25.—IMPROVED CHEVALIER\n(Jordan —Set-Up and Riffle)\nArrange the four suits in four piles reading from top to bottom in the following order: 9,\n5, 3, A, 8, 7, Q, 6, 4, 2, J, K, 10. Riffle shuffle the Hearts and the Spades together and do\nthe same with the Clubs and the Diamonds. One such shuffle leaves each suit in its\noriginal order if the interlaying cards of the other suit are disregarded. Put the Spade -\nHeart packet on top of the Club -Diamond packet, bridging the packets at the division.\nTo present the trick: cut pack at the bridge and riffle shuffle once . Any suit is called for.\nTurn the pack face up, the cards appear to be perfectly well mixed. Remove all the cards\nof the named suit, one at a time, beginning with the first card from the face of the deck\nand placing them in a face down pile. That suit wil l be in the prearranged order. Take the\npile face down and spell out ACE putting one card for each letter under the pile and\nturning up the next, the Ace. Then spell DEUCE and turn the Two: continue in the same\nway up to the King. Special attention should be called to the genuineness of the shuffle.\nNote (Hugard). A better and more convincing plan is to arrange the suits as above and\nassemble the pack with the Clubs on top, followed by Hearts, Spades and Diamonds.\nSplit the pack for the riffle shuffle at t he last Heart. Do the shuffle very openly, calling\nattention to its fairness. Split the pack again at the last Spade and riffle again. The first\nshuffle spreads each suit into another, the second spreads them throughout the deck but in\nthe same relative or der. This makes the trick one of the strongest of all prearranged\nspelling tricks. It can be repeated with any of the three remaining suits.\n26.—SPELLING ANY CARD CALLED FOR\n(Prearrangement)\nThe whole deck must be set up in the following order: values 2, A, J, K, 3, Q, 5, 6, 7, 8,\n9, 10, 4. Suits, C., H., S., D. The key cards for the suits are: for Clubs, 5D; for Hearts,\n55 QC; for Spades, QH; for Diamonds, KS. These key cards are either long or wide cards so\nthat any one of them may be found instantly. To s pell any card called for cut at the key\ncard for that suit, bring it to the bottom, and spell out the name of the card according to\nthe following table:\nAce, spell ACE then suit, turn card on last letter.\nTwo, count off two cards to bottom, spell suit, t urn on last letter.\nThree, spell THREE then suit, turn up next card.\nFour, spell FOURTH, spell card, suit, then SUIT and turn last card.\nFive, spell THE FIVE OF, spell suit, turn last card.\nSix, spell THE SIX OF, spell suit, turn next card.\nSeven, spe ll THE SEVEN OF, spell suit, turn last card.\nEight, spell THE EIGHT OF, spell suit, turn next.\nNine, count 1 to 9, spell OF, spell suit, turn last card.\nTen, count 1 to 10, spell suit, turn next card.\nJack, spell JACK, spell suit, turn last card.\nQuee n, spell QUEEN OF, spell suit, turn last card.\nKing, spell KING, spell suit, turn up next card.\nJoker, put in pack at 6th place, spell and throw it out.\nSpell all the suits with the final S.\n27.—THE SHUFFLED SPELLING BEE\n(Set-Up)\nFrom a full pack sepa rate the Clubs and Spades. Arrange the Clubs thus: —2, K, 10, Q, 7,\n3, 4, 9, 5, A, 6, 8, J, and the Spades thus: —3, 8, 7, A, 6, 4, 2, J, K, 10, 9, 5. The red cards\nare left in any order, on top of them put the Clubs and below them the Spades, and the\nJoker somewhere in the middle. You are ready for the trick.\nShow the pack and dividing it for a riffle shuffle call attention to the fairness of the\nshuffle but as a matter of fact it simply spreads the Clubs amongst red cards in the upper\n56 half of the deck and the Spades amongst the other red cards in the lower half. Turn the\ncards face up and remove the Joker, then cut anywhere between the Spades and the Clubs\nand again riffle shuffle very openly. Here again the shuffle has simply spread the two\nblack suits thr ough the deck but their relative order has not been altered and if the\nintervening cards are eliminated the two packets will be just as they were set up.\nGive a spectator the choice of red or black. Interpret his answer as meaning the blacks are\nto be used. Take the deck face up and throw out all the black cards one by one in a heap\nface up; this will reverse their order. Again ask for a choice, this time b etween Clubs and\nSpades; separate the Spades and the Clubs throwing them face up, one at a time, in two\nheaps thus bringing them back to their original order. If Spades are chosen, hand that\npacket to the spectator, if Clubs are named, take that packet you rself as being the one the\ntrick is to be done with. In any case you must take the Clubs. The set -up is arranged so\nthat you can spell with the Clubs each card dealt by the spectator from the Spades packet.\nThis is a most effective arrangement, the two shu ffles will satisfy the most skeptical that\nthere can be no prearrangement. After this demonstration the two packets are left in\nproper order for spelling the cards from the A. to the K. thus A. C. E. and the A. turns up\non the last letter, and so on. The t wo packets can be spelled together, you with one, and\nthe spectator with the other one.\n28.—THE DOUBLE SPELLER\n(8 Cards Arranged)\nEFFECT: —The deck is given a genuine shuffle and is handed to a spectator who deals it\ninto four heaps, face down. He looks a t a card at the top or bottom of any heap, notes it\nand replaces it. A second spectator does the same. You reassemble the pack. One of the\ncards is named and you spell it out, the card appearing on the last letter. Continuing from\nthere you spell out the s econd card.\nSECRET: —Beforehand remove the 3H, QH, 7S and QS and put them on the top of the\npack; then take out the 4, 5, J, and K. of D. and place them on the bottom. To show the\ntrick, riffle shuffle the deck several times without disturbing the four car ds at the top and\nthe bottom. Hand the deck to a spectator and have him deal the cards into four piles one\ncard at a time. This will bring one card of the D. group on the top of each pile and one\ncard of the other set at the bottom. Two spectators now look at a card either on the top or\nthe bottom of any heap and replace them in the same position. You have simply to note\nwhere the two cards are and remembering that there are 13 cards in each pile, that the D.\ngroup spells with 14 letters and the other with 13, reassemble the packets accordingly.\nFor instance if one spectator has looked at a bottom card, you pick it up first; if the\nsecond spectator has looked at a top card put one of the untouched piles on it and take\nthese two next, finally dropping the thr ee packets on the last untouched heap. The two\ncards will then be in position for spelling. The system is so simple no other illustration is\nrequired. As with all these tricks a false shuffle and cuts are necessary to make it\nimpressive.\n57 29.—THE WHISPERIN G SPELLER\n(Tom Sellers)\nRemove the following 9 cards from the deck; 2D, 10D, 6D, AD, 3S, 7S, 8S, 7H, 3H.\nNote that all of these cards spell with 13 letters.\nLet the cards be thoroughly shuffled and take them back. Explain that you will ask the\ntop card t o whisper the name of another card to you. Make a double lift and note the\nsecond card being careful no one else gets a glimpse of it. Replace the two, as one, on top\nof the packet. Name the card you sighted and spell it off letter by letter, putting one c ard\nat the bottom each time. The card will automatically arrive on the last letter. The working\nwill be obvious.\nYou may have the packet shuffled again and repeat the trick ad lib.\n30—THE JOKER SPELLING ROUTINE\nR. W. Hull\nArrange 13 cards from top to bo ttom: 3, 5, Q, A, 10, 9, Joker, 2, 8, 7, Jack, 6, 4. Place a\nKing on top of the rest of the deck. Spell out ACE putting one card on the bottom for\neach letter, turn the Ace and discard it. Continue with the two and the three spelling TWO\nand THREE. Hand pa cket to a spectator to try it. He spells FOUR but turns up the\nJOKER. Put the Joker on the bottom and spell FOUR: the four turns up. Spectator tries\nagain FIVE and again gets the JOKER. Put the Joker on the bottom and spell FIVE: the\nfive turns up. Spectat or tries SIX and gets the JOKER once more. You place the Joker on\nthe bottom and spell SIX, which turns up. Then say you can spell JOKER and get the\ncorrect card. Do so and the seven turns up. Continue with EIGHT turning up that card.\nSpectator now tries NINE and gets the Joker. Put this on the bottom and let some one else\ntry with the same results. This may be done several times. Now put the Joker on the top\nand tell a spectator to spell JOKER and maybe he'll get the nine. He tries but again the\nJoker sho ws up. Replace this on top, and spell NINE: make a double lift and again show\nthe Joker. Look chagrined as you replace the card (really two), then, as a bright thought,\nremove the Joker, really the nine, and put it in someone's pocket. Tell spectator to tr y\nonce more as he certainly will not get the Joker this time. He spells NINE and the\nubiquitous Joker turns up. The card in the pocket turns out to be the elusive nine. Leave\nthe Joker on the top.\nSpell TEN and JACK correctly. Hand the remaining two cards to a spectator to spell\nQueen. As he does so pick up rest of the pack, on top of which is the King. Meantime\nspectator has again got the Joker. Take the two cards, Joker on top and spell QUEEN\nputting the card face down on the table. As someone turns it o ver, top change the Joker\nfor the King. Finally hand this to one of your victims telling him to spell Joker. He passes\nit from hand to hand as he spells and then turns up ... The KING.\n58 31.-VARIATION OF JOKER SPELLING\nThe order of the cards for this one i s: Q, 7, 10, A, 5, Joker, J, 2, 9, 6, Joker, 4, 8, 3. Two\nJokers are used and you have a King in your trousers pocket. Proceed exactly as in the\npreceding trick to the point where you spell the FOUR and it turns up.\nSpell FIVE and SIX correctly, then let spectator try S E V E N; he gets the Joker. Place it\non the bottom and spell SEVEN and turn it up. Do the same for E I G H T and NINE.\nHave the spectator try T E N; he gets the Joker. Put it on the bottom and spell TEN\ncorrectly.\nSpectator spells JACK and again gets the Joker. Place the Joker on the bottom and spell\nJACK correctly.\nNow tell the spectator that he has had so much trouble with the Joker that you want him\nto spell it and get it out of the way. He spells JOKER and turns it up. You take it. Tel l\nhim that as the Joker is out of the way he will be able to spell the Queen without any\ntrouble. He spells QUEEN correctly. As there would be no sense in spelling the King\nwith only one card in his hand you ask him just to show the card. He does so but ag ain he\nhas the Joker and you show the King in your hand. While he was occupied in spelling\nQueen you simply changed the Joker he handed to you for the King which you had in\nyour pocket.\n32.—THE JOKER SPELLER\n(Tom Seller)\nArrange ten cards of mixed suits thus: 3, 5, A, 7, 9, 2, Joker, 8, 6, 4. Take the packet face\ndown and spell in usual way ACE and turn the Ace on the last letter; spell TWO and turn\nthe two on the last letter; spell T H R E E in the same way.\nHand the packet to a spectator to try; he spe lls FOUR and turns the Joker. Take the pack,\nreplace the Joker on top and spell FOUR and turn the four. Spell FIVE and turn it up.\nSpectator tries to spell SIX and again gets the Joker. You spell SIX and follow with S E\nV E N correctly. Spectator tries EIG HT and once more the Joker appears. You spell\nEIGHT and it turns up.\nSpectator tries to spell NINE and gets the Joker —you spell it correctly. Hand the last\nremaining card to the spectator saying, \"That's just your little joke.\" Note that every time\nthe Jo ker turns up it must be replaced on the top.\n33.—SURE WINNER SPELLING BEE\nEFFECT: —The magician takes 11 cards, Ace to Jack inclusive, and holds them face\ndown. He slaps the packet twice and turns up the top card, it is an Ace. He puts the next\ncard under the others. He turns up the new top card, it is the deuce. Proceeding in th e\n59 same way, one card dealt face up, the next one placed under the others, the cards come\nout in order from Ace to Jack. Picking up the packet the magician slaps it once and\nrepeats the same deal, but this time only the odd cards come out in rotation. Again he\ndeals as before but without slapping the packet and the cards come out hopelessly mixed.\nHe hands the packet to a spectator and he deals them in the same way but again they are\nmixed up. Taking the packet once more the magician slaps it twice and deals them as\nbefore, one out and one under, and the cards come out in proper rotation from Ace to\nJack.\nSECRET: —The eleven cards must be arranged thus: A, 9, 2, 7, 3, J. 4, 8, 5, 10, 6.\nFollowing the system of dealing one card and placing the next on the bott om this rotation\nbrings the cards out in order, Ace to Jack and after three repetitions they are\nautomatically brought back to their original order. Instead of the slap any mystic\nincantation may be used. The cards should be placed in order secretly at the top of the\npack and a false cut made so that they appear to be taken at random.\n34.—FRANK SQUIRES' SPELLER\n(Lloyd Jones, contributor)\nThe following 15 cards: 3, 4, 9, 10, J, K, of Spades and Diamonds, the Q and 8 of Hearts\nand the 7 of Clubs, in any ord er, are placed in the middle of the deck. One of them is\nforced, a very simple matter. The selected card has then to be returned to the pack so that\nit will be the 21st card down. A short card may be used to ensure this or a count made as\nthe cards are spr ead for selection and a break held below the 20th card. False shuffling\nbefore and after will add to the effect.\nThe card having been returned to the required position, 21st, place the pack, well squared\non the table and announce that instead of finding t he card you will let it find itself. Ask\nthe following questions, \"Red or black card?\" \"What suit?\" \"High or low?\" \"Odd or\neven?\" \"and the card?\" The answer to each question is spelled out, the selected card\nturning up on the last letter of the last questi on.\nFor example: suppose the Jack of Diamonds is selected . . .\nQ. \"Red or black? A. \"Red\" (three cards dealt off)\nQ. \"What suit?\" A. \"Diamond.\" (seven cards.)\nQ. \"Odd or even?\" A. \"Odd.\" (three cards.)\nQ. \"High or low?\" A. \"High.\" (four cards.)\nQ. \"And the card?\" A. \"Jack.\" (four cards.)\nAnd the Jack turns up accordingly.\n60 Note that no \"s\" is used in any of the suits spelled. The effect can be repeated by forcing\nselection from the part of the set -up not disturbed.\n35.—GWYNNE'S SPELLER\nThe pack is arranged with the four aces on the top, followed by the four twos, then the\nfour threes, and so on up to the four Kings.\nRemarking that people often wonder why cards are called Ace, King, Jack, etc.,\nperformer deals cards as he spells A C E, a card for e ach letter turning up an ace on the\n\"E.\" Continuing in the same way he spells TWO and turns a two. All the cards are spelled\nout the same way to the last card of the pack, which turns up on the \"G\" in the word\nKING.\n36.—SPELL IT YOURSELF"

    "text": "Two pac ks with same backs are required. From one take two sets of six cards as\nfollows: —No. I —AC, 6H, JS, 8S, 9D, QD,; No. 2 —10C, AS, KH, 7S, 4D, 8D. Note that\nthe names of the cards in each set spell with from 10 to 15 cards in order. Now place\nthese 12 cards al ternately in the pack so that they lie at even numbers from 2 to 24. Put\nthe pack on the table. Remember that any card from 2 to 12 belongs to set No. 1, and\nfrom 14 to 24 to set No. 2. Call this pack \"A.\"\nPack \"B\" is set with the same cards in the same o rder on top, then place any nine cards on\ntop of them. It follows that any card of set No. 1 will spell out from the top of the deck,\nbut to spell any cards of set No. 2 six cards must be cut to the bottom. This pack is placed\nin the left coat pocket on its side.\nTo do the trick; you say you will have a card selected by a spectator and that you,\nyourself, will take no part in the test. Hand the pack to someone and ask him to call the\nfirst number he thinks of up to 25. If he names an even number tell him t o count down to\nthat number and look at that card, but if he chooses an odd number he is to deal off that\nnumber of cards and note the next one. Turn your back while he does this. You know that\nif the number is 12 or less his card is in set No. 1, if over 12 it is in set No. 2. Tell the\nspectator to put the card back in the pack and shuffle it. Turning to him you take the deck,\nstressing the fact that the card has been chosen by absolute chance, that no one but\nhimself knows the card and not even he knows w here it is in the pack. You tell him he is\nto put the deck in his pocket, then for the first time name his card and spell it out taking\none card from his pocket for each letter in its name. To illustrate what he is to do, drop\nthe pack in your left coat po cket standing it upright so that the cards cannot become\nmixed with those of the other pack. You name any card, say the 4S, and bring out six\ncards one at a time as you spell FOUR OF ————— taking them from the top of pack\n\"B.\" Holding these six cards in yo ur right hand, bring out pack \"B\" with your left hand.\nNow if the chosen card stood at 12 or under in pack \"A,\" replace these six cards on top\n61 and hand the deck to the spectator. If, however, the card was in the second set, that is, a\nnumber over 12, put t he six cards on the bottom of the pack.\nThe spectator puts the pack in his pocket and now for the first time he names his card.\nBuild up the effect by stressing the fact that no one else knew what card he had in mind,\nthat he shuffled the pack himself and that no one can possibly tamper with the cards since\nthey are in his possession. He proceeds to spell the name of his card, bringing out a card\nfor each letter and on the last letter produces his very card.\nIf the change of packs is carried through in an off-hand and natural way, without\nfumbling, the trick is one of the most effective of all spelling tricks.\n37.—SELLERS' SPELLER IDEA\n(Tom Sellers)\nEFFECT: —Pack is shuffled freely by spectators and returned. Any card is called for,\nmagician places the deck in his pocket and proceeds to spell out the name of the card\nasked for. The last card he produces proves to be the correct card.\nSECRET: —A duplica te deck of cards. This pack is divided into four packets, one\ncomplete suit in each packet, the cards in each packet running from Ace to King. These\nfour packets are placed, beforehand, one in each of four pockets, for instance, the two\noutside coat pocket s and the two trousers pockets. All you have to do when a card is\ncalled for is to place the pack in the pocket in which the corresponding suit of the\nduplicate pack lies. It is an easy matter to find the required card from the prearranged set,\nat the last letter of the spelling.\nThe placing of the deck in a pocket should be done as if from an afterthought and to make\nthe trick even more difficult.\n38.—INCOMPREHENDO SPELLER\n(Jordan —Set-Up, One Way Card)\nEFFECT: —Spectator selects a card and returns it to the deck. Spelling name of his card\nand dealing from the top a card for each letter, he turns up card on last letter, it is his\ncard.\nSECRET: —The deck has a one -way pattern. Divide pack in half and at bottom of one\nhalf put the 2, 3, 7, 8, Q, of Hearts an d Spades and the A, 6, 10 of Diamonds, in any order\nbut with patterns all the same way. At the bottom of the other packet put the 4, 5, 9, J, K\nof Hearts and Spades, in any order, patterns the same way. Place the packets together,\npatterns of set -up cards all the same way and bridge them.\n62 To present the trick: Cut at the bridge, riffle shuffle once, turning one packet so that its\ncards lie in the opposite direction to the cards of the other. Shuffle as evenly as possible\nso that all the arranged cards will lie at the bottom after the riffle shuffle. Cut about\ncards from the top and put at bottom. Fan the cards for selection of one and secretly hold\na break at the 12th card. Spread the middle cards so that spectator is sure to get one of the\nset-up cards and note, as he takes it, which way the pattern lies so that you know to which\ngroup it belongs. If it is one of the group containing Diamonds it will spell with\nletters, so you cut at the break, have the card replaced there and drop the 12 cards on top ;\nif from the other group it spells with 12 letters, so you release one card from above the\nbreak and cut only 11 cards. Spell DEUCE, THREE, JACK, not Two, Trey, Knave.\n39.—PERFECT SPELLING TRICK\nThe pack used consists of four sets of 13 duplicate cards, that is, the name cards in the\nsame order thus: 3H, 8S, 6D, QS, 7S, AD, 8H, 10D, 7H, QD, QH, 3S, 2H. Each of these\ncards spells with 13 letters (spell 2H; deuce' but 2D; 'two').\nWhen a card is dra wn by a spectator, cut at that point, and put the lower heap on the top\nof the pack. When the card has been noted and is returned to the pack, be careful it goes\nin at a point more than 13 cards from the top. Since the cut has placed a duplicate of the\ncard drawn exactly 13 cards from the top, the spelling must bring it out on the last letter.\nWhen spelling the card deal the cards face up which not only shows that all the cards are\ndifferent but keeps them in correct order. By running through the deck and finding the\ncard that was actually chosen and putting it on top of the pack, the trick can be repeated\nad lib. The card will be very easily found since it is out of the regular order.\n40.—CARD SPELLING DELUXE"

    "text": "EFFECT: —The performer fans the dec k showing the cards to be all different. After\nhaving the deck cut several times, a spectator is requested to cut the cards wherever he\npleases, while the magician's back is turned, remove the top card, note what it is, insert\nthat card in the middle of th e deck and then place the whole pack in the outside pocket of\nhis coat.\nThis done, performer turns and tells the spectator he will remove cards one by one from\nspectator's pocket. Simultaneously, the spectator is to spell his card mentally, one letter\nfor each card mentally, one letter for each card so taken, and to think of the word \"Stop,\"\nwhen the last letter is reached. After removing a number of cards from the pocket,\nperformer suddenly says, \"You have just thought of the word 'Stop' and the card I am\nnow holding is the very card you are thinking of.\" Spectator names the card and the\nperformer displays the card he holds —it is that very one.\n63 SECRET: —The deck consists of four sets of duplicate cards, 12 cards in each set. The\ncards are: 5S, KH, QC, 9H, 3S, 8C, 3C, QH. 9S, 4H; JH, KH. Now regardless of where\nthe spectator cuts the deck, if he looks at the top card and replaces it in the middle of the\npack, the 12th card from the top will always be a duplicate of the one at which he looked.\nAny card he may look at will have exactly 12 letters in its name, therefore all the\nperformer has to do is to stop at the 12th card, the astounding result follows.\n41.- LAZYBONES\nPut a short card on the bottom of the deck and below it any other card, say for instance\nthe 2C. Under this again put enough cards to spell its name minus one letter and\nincluding 'of,' this it to say, nine cards. After a riffle shuffle by which it is easy to leave\nthese cards undisturbed at the bottom, have a card freely selected from amongst those\nabove. When the card has been noted have it replaced by making an undercut, thus\nbringing the prearranged cards just above it. False shuffle and false cut, then force the\ncard below the short card, i.e. the 2C. Hold a break and have this card replace d in the\nsame place. False shuffle again and then cut at the short card thus bringing it and the\nstock to the top of the deck.\nTurn the top card face up to show that it is not either of the chosen cards. Leaving it face\nup on the deck, make a double lift, getting the 2C secretly below this card. Hold the two\nas one in the same position and with the left hand turn the pack over on them to show the\nbottom card also is an indifferent one. The 2C will now be reversed below the rest of the\ndeck. Cut the pack br inging this card to the middle and turn the pack face down. Hand the\npack to the spectator who drew the 2C. He runs through the pack and finds his card face\nup. Tell him to cut the pack at that card and place the cut aside together with the 2C and\nspell it s name TWOOFCLUBS, dealing one card for each letter. When he arrives at the\n'S' have the chooser of the first card name it. The card is turned up, it is correct.\n42.—THINK OF A CARD\n(Annemann —Set-Up and Short)\nEFFECT: —From a long row of cards spread on t he table, spectator merely thinks of one.\nPack is assembled and cut, spectator spells name of his card, dealing one card for each\nletter and turns up his card on the last letter.\nSECRET: —18 cards on the top of the deck are arranged in three sets of six th us: AC, 5C,\n5H, 7S, 9D, 3D; 2C, 6H, 4S, 8S, 4D, 8D; 10C, 10H, QC, 10D, JD, QD. Each group is\ncomposed of cards which spell out with 10, 11, 12, 13, 14 and 15 letters. Note that the\nfirst group contains only odd cards, the second only even cards, and the th ird has cards of\nvalue ten or over. The ninth card from the bottom is a short. Begin by laying out the cards\nin a row from left to right, each card overlapping about half an inch. 18 cards will make a\nlong row, so stop at that point and ask a spectator to mentally select one card.\n64 Gather up the cards and replace them on the rest of the deck, false shuffle, then cut at the\nshort thus bringing nine cards on top of the set -up. Have the card named and you at once\nknow to which group it belongs. If in the first , hand the pack to the spectator to spell his\ncard, which will turn up on the last letter. If it is in the second group you must illustrate\nwhat the spectator has to do by spelling out, say, FIVE OF ————— and stop on the\nsixth card, asking if he understand s. Drop the deck on these six cards and hand all to the\nspectator. If, however, the card is in the third group 12 cards must be dealt off in the\ndemonstration and the rest dropped on them before spectator begins to spell his card. This\nis a subtler method than dealing the cards in three groups of six.\n43.—THE SPELLING BEE\n(Cannel —Key Card)\nEFFECT: —From a thoroughly shuffled deck, three spectators each choose freely any\nfour cards. Each of them mentally selects one card. Performer, going to one of them and\ncutting the deck, says, \"Please put your card here,\" and he holds out the lower portion of\nthe deck. \"Now drop your other cards on top of it,\" he adds. He then openly drops the rest\nof the pack on top of these. He goes through the same procedure with the other two\npersons and then shuffles the pack. Asking the last person who replaced his ca rd to name\nthe one he thought of, suppose it is the 6S., the performer spells SIX, taking off a card for\neach letter and turns the next, it is the 6S. He does the same with the other two. The value\nonly is spelled, the suits are ignored.\nSECRET: —A key car d is required, a short, a long or any kind of key card you prefer.\nWhen the first spectator replaces his card you have cut the deck including the key card.\nDrop the cut on top openly and square up. Go to the second person, again cut at and\ninclude the key card and have his four cards replaced, thus bringing them on top of the\nother four. Do the same with the third person. Finally cut at the key as before and shuffle\nthe cards in the right hand on the face of the lower packet, thus bringing the three sets of\nfour cards to the top of the deck. Begin with the third person and ask him to name his\ncard; if it is an A, 2, 6, or 10, spell and take off three cards turning up the fourth; if it is\nthe 4, 5, 9, J, or K, turn the fourth card; if it is a 3, 7, 8, or Q, p ull the fourth card back on\nthe deck with the left thumb, take it off again and show it as the fifth card. Hold this card\nin your hand as you ask the next person to name his card —if it is a three or four letter\ncard drop it with the others on the table, bu t if it happens to be a five letter card put it\nback on top, making the spelling correct. Do the same for the remaining card.\n“You” Do As “I” Do Card Mysteries"

Place the pack face down on his hand. In directing\nhis attention to the position of his hand you have tilted his pack very slightly and\nglimpsed the bottom card which you remember. On thi s the whole trick depends.\nInstruct him to take a card from the middle of his pack, note what it is and put it on the\ntop of his pack. Then to reach over, take a card from your pack and place it face down on\nyour left hand. You look at this card and murmu r \"Quite a coincidence.\" Lay the card on\ntop of your pack.\nTell the spectator to do exactly as you do. Cut your pack and complete the cut. He does\nthe same. Cut again. He also cuts. Square your cards very carefully: he does the same.\nHand your pack to him and he takes yours. Tell him to find his card while you find yours\nand both cards are placed face down on the table. He names his card and turns it over,\nyou turn yours, the cards are the same. \"Quite a coincidence,\" you remark again.\nWhen the spectator cut his pack the bottom card which you had previously noted was\nbrought on top of the card he chose. All you have to do is, after changing packs, to find\nthe key card and put out the card that follows it.\nAs in all the versions of the trick it depends on the fact that the mind cannot think of two\nthings at once while executing a manual operation which requires the use of the eyes and\nthe mind.\n66 YOU DO AS I DO\nIn this version the two packs are shuffled and exchanged, then both are again shuffled\nand exchan ged but before handing over your pack you sight the top card. The best way to\ndo this is to sight the bottom card when taking the pack from the spectator then with an\noverhand shuffle bring that card to the top. In this way there is no movement of any kind\nto arouse any suspicion in the spectator's mind as the cards are exchanged the second\ntime.\nSpread your pack on the table, the spectator does the same. Take out a card from your\nspread, look at it and put it on the top. He does the same. Square your pack and cut it and\nhe follows suit. Change packs once more, tell the spectator to take out his card while you\ntake out yours. Really you take no notice of the card you drew, but simply remove the\ncard above the card you sighted on the top of his pack. The two cards are turned and\nprove to be the same.\nThroughout the trick lay great stress on having the spectator work in exact unison with\nyou as if everything depended on that."

You doubt my words?\nYou think I exaggerate? To convince you I shall furnish three witnesse s. Here are two\npacks of cards. Now in order to get our minds perfectly attuned will you please go\nthrough exactly the same motions as I do?\nFirst we both mix the cards we hold by the same kind of shuffle. Now we exchange packs\nso that I hold the pack you shuffled and you hold the pack I shuffled. Again we shuffle —\nand exchange packs. Next we fan our cards and remove one, any one —but first please\nlook steadily in my eyes for a moment. Ready. Remember your card and place it face\ndown on the table. Now square up your cards and put the chosen one on top of the pack,\njust as I do with the card I have chosen.

You\nthink you had a free choice. I am sorry to contradict you. You were compelled by the\ninfluence of my mind over yours to think of exactly the same card that I myself was\nthinking of and which I have placed on the table opposite yours.\nPlease do not alter the card in your mind because those two cards on the table are so to\nspeak, two subpoenaed witnesses to you r choice. But three are more convincing than two,\nso I shall provide a third —in black and white this time. (Write card on slip, fold it and put\nit between the two cards.)

    "text": "Two packs of cards are used. From No. 1 take any card , say the 10S. and from the upper\nright hand corner cut off a piece of such size that the missing part can be covered by the\nball of the thumb. Put this card on top of the pack. From No. 2 pack take any indifferent\ncard and put it face up on top of a goble t standing on a table that will be a little distance\nfrom the spectators. From the front this card will be unnoticeable. Put the 10S. from this\npack also on the top.\nThus prepared, begin by handing pack No. 2 to a spectator, after having made several\nfalse shuffles and cuts. Tell him to hold the pack tightly while he mentally selects any\nnumber between 1 and 52. When you turn your back he is to deal cards to the number\nchosen, pick up the cards dealt and replace them on the remainder of the deck. This done\ntake the pack and put it face up on the goblet, i. e. on the card that lies on the mouth of\nthe goblet. One card is thus added to the deck and it follows that the 10S. the original top\ncard will now be one card further down in the deck than the number cho sen and dealt to\nby the spectator.\n\nPick up pack No. 1 and shuffle it retaining the mutilated 10S. on the top. Tell the\nspectator you will deal the cards one by one and ask him to call \"Stop\" when you have\ndealt to the number he mentally selected. Appare ntly you deal fairly, really pull the cards\none by one from under the missing corner of the top card, the 10S., which therefore,\nremains on the top. When the spectator calls \"Stop,\" pick up the 10S. so that the thumb\nand finger hide the missing corner and hold it face down. Invite the spectator to take pack\nNo. 2 from the goblet, deal cards face down to the number mentally selected and turn the\nnext card. He does this and shows the 10S. You turn the card in your hand and show ——\nthe 10S.\n77 A CARD SYMPATHY\nAny two packs may be used but they must both be set up in some regular order such as\nthe Si Stebbins or \"Eight Kings, etc.\", system. The packs are then replaced in their cases\nand put ready for use on the table.\nAllow a spectator to freely choose either p ack, take out the cards and thoroughly shuffle\nthem. Instruct him then to fan out the cards and you take one, pretending to note what it\nis, and return it to his deck, not letting him see what card it is, and again he is to shuffle\nhis cards. Take the othe r pack from its case, make several false shuffles and cuts, then\nspread the cards and invite the spectator to make a free choice of one card. Separate the\ncards at the point from which he draws a card and hold the hands apart for a moment or\ntwo, then put the two packets together but put the right hand cards under those in your\nleft. A glance at the bottom card will indicate to you the name of the card the spectator\nhas drawn. He replaces the card and you shuffle the pack.\nThe packs are exchanged, instruct the spectator to take out the card he chose and put it\nface down on the table, while you do the same. You simply find the duplicate of his card\nwhich you know thanks to the system and put it out face down. The two cards are turned\nface up and they corresp ond in suit and value."

    "text": "(Dr. Jacob Daley)\nIn this version of \"You Do As I Do,\" only one deck is used and but a moment of\npreparation is needed, if it can be called that.\nTake any deck and note the two face cards as you hold them facing y ou. These should be\npreferably a red and a black card. Run through the deck and pass to the top or back of the\ndeck the two cards of the same value and color. Thus, for example, the bottom and top\ncards might be the fours of clubs and spades, and the secon d card from top and bottom\nmight be the tens of hearts and diamonds.\nStart by dovetail shuffling the pack so as to retain the top and bottom pairs in their\nrespective places. Then place the deck on the table and ask the spectator to cut it into two\npiles. At this point you pick up each half and shuffle it overhand style and there is a bit of\nskull -duggery in this that is far from being difficult. Pick up the top half first and\noverhand shuffle, running the two top cards one at a time and shuffling the rest on top.\nThis puts them on bottom in reversed order. Shuffle once more but the fingers (of the\nhand holding the cards) against the face or bottom card, hold it there while the rest of the\nunder portion is drawn away and shuffled off on top to the last card which is left on top,\nand this half of pack is replaced on the table. The other half is picked up and given only\none shuffle. The fingers of hand holding the cards rest against the face of packet and\nretain the bottom card while the under portion of packe t is drawn away and shuffled off\non top to the last card. Replacing this half on the table, both halves are now apparently\n78 well mixed. However, the top card of each packet (if arranged as described before) is a\nred ten, and the bottom card of each is a bla ck four. Up to this moment everything has\nbeen perfectly aboveboard as the deck was genuinely shuffled to start, then cut by a\nspectator, and each half shuffled again.\nThe spectator is asked to pick up a packet and you take the other. Each of you deal a c ard\nat a time into a face down pile together until the spectator wishes to stop. Immediately\nyou prove an unseen force at work by turning each packet face up on the table and\nshowing two red tens. Now you ask him to count the remainder of his cards onto th e table\nsingly in a pile and at the same time you do likewise. If he has the most, he is to place his\ntop card (as deck stands now) face down on the table without looking at it. You turn over\nyour top card (making a two card turnover), show it, turn it ove r again with back up and\ndeal it on table. Now he turns his card and it is a black four. You look surprised and say\nthat to be correct your card should also be a black four. Turn your card over and it is seen\nto have changed to match his card. If you had t he larger packet in the counting, you\nmerely do your turnover first and lay the card out, asking him to turn over his after and\nfinish the same. If both packets have the same number of cards you call attention to the\nfact that he cut them himself and that the two packets have a strange attraction for each\nother. Anyway you have him, the cards match and the number of cards in each pile only\nserves as the excuse for the counting to reverse the packets and make possible the last\npart of the trick."

The\nworking will suffice to make clear the effect itself.\nHand one deck to one person and have him shuffle. As he finishes this, hand the second\ndeck to the other person to mix also. While he shuffles, take back the first deck an d give\nit a further mixing while obviously waiting for the second person to finish. You note both\nthe top and bottom cards of your pack. It is easy to merely note the bottom card, shuffle it\noverhand to the top, and note the new bottom card. Now take the d eck from the second\nperson and place your \"keyed\" deck in his hands.

Take a card from the center of\nyour pack and look at it. He does the same. Put it on top and cut the pack. He does\nlikewise. Now look at the s econd person and repeat the procedure. Now have them put\n79 the two halves together and cut once more. Take the pack from them and at the same time\nhandling the first man your pack. Tell him to run through it and remove the card he\nlooked at. He does so and h ands the rest of the pack to the second person, he looks them\nover and removes his card too. You fan your deck and remark that at the same time you'll\ntake out the two cards you picked by chance. Lay your deck aside and hold the two cards\nwith the backs ou t. The first man turns his card so all can see. You turn one of your cards,\nit is the same. The second man turns his card. Your remaining card matches.\nRemembering the two key cards your task has been but a pleasure. When you run through\nthe deck they hav e looked at and handled, you have only to remove the card to the left (or\nabove) the known top card, which is that looked at by the first person, and the card to the\nright (or below) the known bottom card.

Let the deck be freely shuffled: take it back and\nsecretly press the outer index corner of the top card between the nail of the second finger\nand the bal l of the thumb of the right hand. This will cause a slight lump on the back of\nthe card, readily felt by the thumb in dealing. Lay the deck down, ask for a spectator to\nassist you, first by calling a number, then by dealing cards to that number face\ndownwa rds on the table. This done tell him to select a card from those remaining in his\nhands, note what it is, place it face down on the heap of counted cards, shuffle the\nremainder and put them on top of all, finally to cut the assembled deck as often as he\npleases, completing each cut. Next he is to take up the pack and deal two heaps, one card\nat a time face down alternately, putting the heap on which the last card was dealt on top\nof the other, square the deck and again cut the pack.\n82 You take the pack and d eal slowly till you reach the marked card, you then at once\nannounce the number at which the chosen card now lies. The calculations depends on the\nnumber of cards dealt by the spectator on top of which he placed his card. If it is an even\nnumber simply div ide by two, thus 12 divided by 2 gives 6, his card will lie 6 cards\nbelow the key card. If the number is odd, take the larger half and add to it 26 (half the\nnumber of cards in the pack), thus the larger half of 17 is 9 which added to 26 gives 35,\nthe card will lie at that number."

Deal to the 39th card and stop, throwing the card out. Replace the\ndealt cards fa ce down on the remainder. Discover the 26th card, the second chosen, by\nreading the spectator's mind. Spell out the first person's card, the 13th; any card can be\nspelt with 12 or 13 cards by manipulating the words \"the\" and \"of.\"\nReplace the cards dealt and casually display the bottom card so that the fourth person will\nnote it. Turn the pack face down and glide the bottom card back. Tell him that you will\ndeal from the bottom and stop at any card he calls for. Pull out the second card from the\nbottom and put it face down. Pull out the next one above the pulled back card, show its\nface and replace it on the bottom, covering the chosen card and again casually display the\npack face outwards. The person will be convinced you have made a mistake and that his\ncard has been put on the table. Turn the pack down, deal the bottom card, letting its face\nbe seen as you put it on the first card dealt. Draw back the next card, the chosen card and\nretain it, dealing the cards above it one by one until the person tells yo u to stop. Draw out\nhis card, put it face down apart and place a coin or a pencil on it. You claim that that card\nis his. Having seen, as he thought, that his card was already dealt, he is bound to say you\nare wrong. Work this up, then turn the dealt cards face up, his card is not there. Have it\nnamed and turn it over."

    "text": "EFFECT: —Shuffle and cut any deck and leave the room. A spectator then follows the\ninstructions you previously gave him thus — he thinks of a number under 10 and deals\nfrom the face down deck cards to that number and notes the last card. He then continues\ndealing a card at a time on each card already dealt until there are not enough left to cover\nthe row; these cards he places on the last pile, at the bottom of which is the card he noted.\n91 He picks up this heap first, places it on the next to the left, these two on the next and so\non until the deck is reassembled. He cuts several times and you return. You deal the cards\nand stop on the noted card.\nMETHOD: —Secretly note the two top cards of the deck after the shuffle; make a false\ncut. When the spectator follo ws your directions the original top card becomes the bottom\ncard of the first heap, and the second card will be at the bottom of the second heap. When\nyou return fan the deck and cut it to bring the second card you noted somewhere near the\ntop of the deck. Turn the deck face down and deal the cards face up. Suppose the original\ntop card was the 7H and the second card the 3C. When the 3C appears start counting and\nstop at the 7H. This gives you the number of cards dealt in each heap. Divide 52 by this\nnumber and if there is no remainder then the spectator's card is that number below the\n7H. If there is a remainder add it to the number, the total will give the position of the\nnoted card below the original top card.\nExample: —with the two top cards as above 7H, 3C. You find the 7H six cards below the\n3C. 52 divided by 6 gives 8 and a remainder of 4, 6 added to 4 equals 10, therefore the\nchosen card is ten cards below the 7H.\n“Slick” Principles in Card Magic\nThe first record of the use of the \"slick\" card tha t I have been able to find is by Robert -\nHoudin in his book \"Les Tricheries des Grecs\" under the title of \"la carte glissee.\"\nProbably the device had been used by gamblers for many years previously. In an article\nin the Sphinx of Vol. 23. No. 1. p. 2 Mr. Ma x Holden called the attention of the magical\nfraternity to the many good uses the slick card can be put to. His method of preparing\nsuch a card was to put some parafine wax on the face, spreading it evenly and polishing\nthe card with the back of a spoon. W ith an occasional repolishing such a card will retain\nits slippery quality for a long time. A later method, that is now generally used, is\nautomobile Simoniz. Simply coat the card and rub it briskly with a cotton swab, let it dry\novernight. Put on a second coat, again rub it with a soft cotton cloth and let it dry\nthoroughly. It is advisable to polish the face again before using.\nBefore going into the explanation of tricks based on the use of such a card a short\ndescription of the proper method of handling it will be necessary. Insert a slick card about\nthe middle of the deck and square up the cards. Hold the pack in the left hand as if about\nto deal. Place your right fingers under the deck at the end nearest you and the thumb on\ntop, push forward with the thumb, exerting a little pressure. You will find that the deck\nwill split at the slick card. Cut at this point and that card will be at the bottom.\nAgain insert the card and shuffle so that you do not know just whereabouts it is. Hold the\ndeck in the left hand and square it. Put your right thumb and fingers in the same position\nas before but hold the pack upright and push with the thumb just enough to locate the\npoint at which the cards break. Turn the pack down and fan the cards but keep your eye\non the b reak so that you know exactly where the slick card is. Have a card chosen and\nreplaced to the left of the break, that is under the key card, and square up. When you\nagain locate the break and cut at it the selected card will be on the top and the key card at\nthe bottom.\nWhen you know the key card is in the middle, with the right thumb and fingers in the\nsame position as before, push off about a dozen cards and slide them to the bottom. Now\n93 with the right thumb again push on the cards but this time exert a little pressure and the\ncards will break at the key card; take these cards off and put them on the bottom, the key\ncard becoming the bottom card of the pack.\nWith the pack behind your back the cards can be made to break at the slick card in just\nthe same way, that is by pressure of the right thumb and fingers.\nIt will be readily recognized that by having a chosen card inserted in the pack, either\nabove or below the slick card and the pack squared up, the chosen card can be brought to\nthe bottom or top of the pack at will by making the break as described and then cutting at\nthat point. As facility in the use of the card is acquired the break can be located by\npressure of the left thumb. It must lie flat on the back of the top card. then with the cards\nvery slightly spread, make it press downwards and outwards, the cards will break at the\nslick card. The push must be made with the thumb flat on the top card, not just the tip,\nand the cards should be held as flatly as possible.\nYou may have the slick card on the bottom, then a card having been chosen, undercut for\nits return, dropping the lower portion on top, thus bringing the slick card immediately\nabove it. Square the pack, locate the break and cut the cards. The chosen card is on the\ntop and the slick card again on the bottom.\nFinally avoid making the break when attention is focused on the pack, do it when the\nattention is directed elsewhere."

However, the method may be\n94 useful on occasion to squelch the obnoxious individual who has the little knowledge that\nis so dangerous to the magician when coupled with a mean disposition.\nThe method is simple. After a card has been chosen, as the spectator is noting it, locate\nthe break at the slick card, cut there a nd have the card returned under it, square the deck\nopenly and hand it to the spectator to be shuffled. It is well to indicate with your hands\nthe action of an overhand shuffle as you give the pack, for with this type of shuffle the\nodds are in your favor, viz, that the two cards will not be separated are about 10 to 1. If\nthe spectator insists on a riffle shuffle the chances are not so favorable. I have been\nassured, however, by performers who make use of the method that they have never failed\ntwice in suc cession."

In such case\nyou ask him to replace it in the same spot and simply note how many cards are between it\nand the slick card, above or below, as the case may be.

In th e old method the performer had to\ncontrol the card every time it was replaced in order to force it on the next person, and\nunless he was an expert in palming he could not allow the spectators to shuffle the cards.\nBy using the slick card as the force card the trick becomes not only much more effective\nbut much easier to do. You can allow each person to replace the card anywhere in the\npack that he pleases and shuffle to his heart's content, yet you can find the card in a\nmoment and have it in readiness to force on the next spectator. An expert in straight\nforcing will have no difficulty with that part of the trick but for most card workers it is a\ngood plan to use a variety of forces. A reference to Annemann's \"202 Ways of Forcing\"\nwill be useful in this connection.\nAnother good finish is to pick out as many cards including the slick card as have been\nchosen, spread them fanwise and ask if everyone see s his card. They all do, of course.\nThrow away one card and repeat the question. Continue in the same way until it dawns\non them that they all picked the same card from the shuffled deck."

With this card at the\nbottom allow these cards to be freely selected. Shuffle the slick card to the middle and\nhave the first card replaced immediately above it.

    "text": "This effective series of tricks makes use of the slick card and a set up. The slick card may\nbe any card at all but we will suppose it is the 9S. From the top of the pack downwards\narrange the following cards: 7S. 9D. KD. AH. 9S. KH. 7D. AD. KC. 9C. AS. 8S. 8D. 9H.\n5C. 6C. 10S. KS. 6D. JH. JD. 4D. 6H. Twenty -three cards in all.\nThese cards must be on the top of the pack, the slick card on the bottom and next above\nthe key card, a seven. When introducing the routine a false shuffle should be executed.\nFor an explanation of the best methods see chapter on \" Indispensable Sleights.\"\n1. Casually count off five cards, reversing them, and replace them on the top (this is done\nfor a purpose that appears later). Fan the deck and have a card freely selected from below\nthe arranged cards. As the spectator notes his card, under cut, have the card replaced on\ntop and drop the lower portion on it. The slick card is now just above the chosen card.\nSquare the cards very openly. Go to a second person, squeeze the deck, locate the break\nand force the same card on him. The first spectator is asked to name his card, second\nspectator shows that is the card he holds. Or, you may simply bring card to the top, palm\nit off and produce it from your pocket. In either case replace the card in the lower part of\nthe pack.\n2. The next effect is one of predicatio n. In reversing the first five cards at the beginning\nyou brought the top card, 7S to the fifth place. To bring them back to the same order you\nillustrate what you want a spectator to do. Tell him he is to think of a small number, deal\ncards (you deal five ) place them back on the top (do this with the five cards) pick up and\nlook at the top one (pick it up but don't look at it, you already know that it is the 7S)\nreplace it on top and make one complete cut. (Don't illustrate the cut.)\nBefore the spectator counts his number, take pencil and paper and write \"Seven of\nSpades.\" Put this under some object on the table writing downwards. Turn away while\nspectator counts, looks at top card, replaces it and cuts, squaring up the pack. Turn round,\ntake the pack and while asking the spectator to whisper his number to a second person,\nsqueeze the pack, cut at the break and glimpse the top card. This card is the one just noted\nby the first spectator, so you take the slip of paper and write its name above that already\nwritten, the 7S. The count has brought the 7S to the position to be found by the second\nperson. Hand the pack to the second person instructing him to deal cards to the number\nwhispered to him; to place the packet on the pack, look at the top card and make on e\ncomplete cut. This done, call attention to the fact that in each case you wrote a prediction\nbefore the cards were looked at. Have the cards named, then have a third person take the\nslip, open it and read what you wrote. Under cover of the surprise this causes squeeze the\npack, cut at the break and you have the cards back in their original order.\n3. Have a spectator cut the cards near the middle, put aside the top packet and take up the\nlower one. Make an overhand shuffle retaining the slick card on the bottom and bringing\n98 the 7S to the top. Spread the cards, counting seven and holding a break at that point, and\nhave a card freely chosen and noted. Cut off the seven cards, have the card returned\ncards, counting seven cards on top. False shuffle several ti mes then locate the break and\ncut. Turn the top card, 7S, count off seven cards, ask the spectator to name his card. You\nturn it up.\n4. Take up the other half of the pack and put it on top of the cards in hand. Turn the pack\nto a spectator, tell him to de al off some cards face up one by one on the table, to stop\nwhenever he likes, replace the packet on the face of the pack, note the card facing him\n(the last card dealt,) then give the pack one complete cut. Turn away as this is done.\nWhen he is ready, turn and take the pack, put it behind your back, squeeze and cut to the\nbreak, put the slick card on top as well. Announce that you have found the card and have\nplaced it at the same number from the top as he had it from the bottom. The number is\nnamed, deal t he cards and turn the one at that number, it is the card the spectator noted.\nPut the rest of the cards on top of those just dealt and the pack is again in the arranged\norder.\n5. Now suggest a game of poker, ask how many hands shall be dealt as if it made no\ndifference to you how many, but you must deal either three or four hands. If three is\nchosen, deal three hands of five cards each as in a regular game. This is the result:\n1st hand. 7. 7. 8. 9. A. discards 7. A., gets a straight.\n2nd hand 9. 9. 9. 8. A. discards 8. A., draws two cards.\n3rd hand. K. K. K. 5. A. discards 5. A., draws two J's. full house.\nIf four is chosen, here is the result:\n1st hand 7. 8. 9. 10. K. discards K. draws J. making a straight.\n2nd hand 9. 9. 9. K. K. stands pat\n3rd han d 6. 6. 7. 8. K. discards K. gets 4D. a straight.\n4th hand A. A. A. J. 6. discards the 6. draws J. full on aces.\n6. Assemble the pack thus: take the remainder of the deck and the discards, shuffle\noverhand and leave the key on top. Pick up the hands in a ny order and put them on the\ntop. Cut to the key, hand top half to one -spectator, other half to a second person. Both\nmay shuffle as they please. Second person picks out any card from his packet and pushes\nit into first spectator's cards, and these cards a re then thoroughly shuffled. You find the\ncard.\nThis is the method, counting the values of the cards (J.11, Q.12, and K.13.) the total of\nthe cards in the four hands is 143. To this add the value of the slick card to get the total\n99 before the chosen card i s added to the packet. Simply add the values, subtract and you\nhave the card.\n7. Shuffle the key to the top. A spectator deals as many cards face down on the table as\nhe pleases, counting them as he does so. He squares up the packet and puts it on top. Th is\nwhile your back is turned. Turn again, take the pack, cut to the key card and you instantly\nhave the cards he counted out. Again deal them one by one to show how much quicker\nyou did it, and also to get the key back on the top.\n8. Hand the pack to a sp ectator to shuffle. It is best to have the shuffle by the overhand\nmethod. A riffle shuffle especially with some people who handle cards roughly bends the\ncards and interferes with the manipulation of the slick card. Take pack and have a card\nfreely chosen , noted and replaced under the key card. Square the cards very openly,\ntapping ends and sides on the table, spread and have a second card freely selected. Again\nmake the break at the key and have the card returned at that spot, thus bringing it on top\nof the first card. Square up and immediately hand the pack to a spectator for an overhand\nshuffle. Allow him time for two or three movements, say \"Thank you,\" and take the pack\nback. The odds are almost 100 to 1 against the cards having been separated. Recapit ulate\nwhat has been done, build up the effect and order the two cards to join one another. Show\nthem.\n9. For this effect you require an extra card of the same back pattern, say an 8. spot which\nyou place reversed above the key card which is on the bottom (the author does not say\njust how you are to do this without being observed). On top, place the duplicate 8 from\nthe pack. Count off seven cards, not reversing them, and put them on the bottom.\nAllow a card to be freely selected and noted. Under cut about half the deck and drop on\ntop of the card as it is replaced. Cut to the key card bringing it to the bottom and the\nduplicate 8 to the top. Turn this card and show it, dropping it on the table. Cut the pack,\ntake off several cards from. the top and show th e chosen card is not amongst them, turn\nthe pack face up and show that it is at or near the bottom. Pick up the duplicate 8 spot and\nput it with the pack behind your back.\nSlip the duplicate 8 under your belt.\nBring the pack forward, run over the backs t ill you come to the reversed eight spot. Count\noff seven cards and deal the eighth face down. Have the card named and turn it over.\n10. Hand the pack out to be shuffled. Take it back and cut to the key card bringing it to\nthe bottom. Allow a card to be fr eely replaced, drop the lower portion on top, bringing\nthe chosen card below the key card. Let a spectator square the deck perfectly. Take it and\nput it behind your back. Cut to the key card, take it off the bottom and slip it under your\nbelt. Bring forwar d the card now on the top have the chosen card named and turn the card\nover. Put the pack down and you can bet $1000 that it is absolutely free from any\npreparation.\n101"

    "text": "The first use of diachylon in connection with cards that I have been able to trace was by\nHofzinser, the great card expert who flourished in Vienna in the middle of the XIX\ncentury. It seems to have been kept a closely guarded secret until the appearance o f Prof.\nHoffmann's last book, \"Latest Magic,\" which was published in 1918. From that time its\nuse became increasingly popular and a number of very good tricks dependent on its use\nhave been devised.\nDiachylon, when rubbed on the back of a card, renders it adhesive without altering its\nappearance and if another card is pressed against the surface so treated, the two adhere,\nand to all intents and purposes become one card. The two may be handled freely but can\nbe separated with slight pressure. Hoffmann advi ses that the diachylon in its solid form\nbe rubbed on the card shortly before it is to be used. If used in the paste form, however, it\nis best to apply a very small amount with the blade of a knife. It is not necessary to treat\nthe whole surface of a card, simply apply it to several of the pips if the face of a card is to\nbe treated, or at the corners and the middle of a card, if the back is to be prepared. The\ndiachylon will spread better and make a thinner film if slightly heated first. The following\nmeth od of application is recommended by Judge Fricke:\n\"I have done this by painting the cards with diachylon dissolved in carbon tetrachloride.\nDue to the variation in batches of diachylon some experimenting will have to be done.\nToo heavy a solution holds th e cards too affectionately. It is so nearly colorless that when\napplied no one can notice it. Use a cotton swab, let the cards dry thoroughly before\nreassembling them and the deed is done. I have doped my Svengali cards this way. Thus\nprepared they may be given the regular overhand shuffle as well as the riffle and the two\ncards can be lifted with ease as one. Just sliding off the top (short) card carries with it the\nregular card below it.\"\n102 THE FLYING CARD\nProf. Hoffmann gives two tricks only as illustrat ions of the use of diachylon. In this, the\nfirst, a card box is prepared with a duplicate card, say the 7D, placed in box so that after it\nhas been shown empty, closing it will bring the card into evidence. The top card of the\npack has its back prepared an d the 7D is forced on a spectator. The pack is cut to bring\nthe diachylon card to the middle and the 7D is returned on the top of it. The performer\nhas then merely to square the cards, squeeze them well together and hand the pack to be\nshuffled. Taking the pack he orders the card to leave the pack and fly to the box. He\ncounts the cards one by one showing their faces as he puts them on the table. There are\n51 only, the 7D has disappeared, being safely hidden behind the prepared card. The card\nbox is opened and reveals the 7D.\nBy replacing this card in the box so that the flap will fall on it and so vanish it, then\nseparating the double card in the pack, the 7D may be made to reappear in the pack. But\nin any case the trick in this form is rather crude, thoug h it might be made an effective\ninterlude in a more elaborate effect."

Hand the remainder of the pack to be\nthoroughly shuffled.\nLet a spectator cut the deck about one -third down, place one of the indicator cards face\nup on the lower portion and have the cut replaced.

Put this pair anywhere in the pack, the two short cards on\ntop.\nForce the two shorts and have them replaced and the p ack shuffled overhand by the\nspectator. When you take it back and riffle the ends you stop at the double card\nautomatically, separate the two cards and show that they have come together.

From any deck, thoroughly\nshuffled, allow a card to be freely selected, noted and replaced. Bring it to the top and\nhave another person select a card As he notes is transfer the diachylon to the back of the\ntop card. Under cut the deck for the return of the second card so that it goes on top of the\nfirst one. Drop the lower portion on top, square and squeeze the cards and hand them to\nbe shuffled overhand fashion. Finally the cards are named and you s how they have come\ntogether, push them apart as you show them.\nDouble Back Principles in Card Magic\nThe first double backed cards put on the market were used in the trick called \"Two Card\nMonte,\" and sold by Theodore L. Deland about the year 1910. However I have reason to\nbelieve that the principle was known to and used by Hofzinser many years ago. Delan d's\ntrick is more of a joke than a feat of magic but it opened the way for the invention of\nmany fine tricks dependent on the use of the double back principle."

One pile is chosen, the a ces vanish from the other three piles and all\nfour are found in the pile selected. The use of double faced cards makes the trick easy to\nwork and very convincing.\nThree special cards are required; doubled faced aces of Hearts, Clubs and Diamonds,\nwhich sh ow indifferent cards on the backs. To prepare the pack, turn it face upwards and\nput the double cards at intervals near the bottom with the ace sides showing. Next place\nthe regular Ace of Spades between the second and third fake aces. The other three aces of\nthe pack must lie seventh, eighth and ninth from the top.\nBegin by turning the pack face up and remove four aces, (three faked ones and the\nregular Ace of Spades) and lay them face up on the table with the Ace of Spades as the\nthird card in the row. B e careful not to expose the lower side of the faked cards but you\nmay flash the back of the real Ace of Spades. From the top of the pack take off three\ncards, show the faces casually and put them face down on the first ace. Take the next\nthree cards, again give a slight flash of their faces and drop them on the second ace. The\nnext three cards, the three real aces, you take off and drop on the Ace of Spades. Without\nshowing the faces and, finally, take three more cards and drop them on the last ace.\nThe th ird pile must now be forced. You may either use the old method of having the two\npiles touched, and then one pile —using the old take of leave equivoque —or you may ask\nfor a number between 1 and 4 to be named. This leaves 2 and 3 the only possible\nnumbers, either of which brings you to the required pile according to which end you\nbegin the count from. In any case pile No. 3 is placed aside.\nYou order the aces to pass to the chosen heap with whatever hocus pocus you may affect.\nPick up the first pile with yo ur right hand, the three top cards face down and the fake ace\nup. Raise the hand, push the top card off and throw it face up on the table with a quick\nturn of the wrist. Raise the hand again but this time push out the fake ace with the fingers\nand throw it ace side down on top of the first card. Continue without hesitation by\nthrowing the next card as you did the first. One card, an indifferent one, remains in your\nhand; turn it face upwards quickly, snap it with your fingers, showing it freely and drop it\non the others. The ace has vanished.\nProceed in exactly the same way with the other two piles, but vary the throw of the fake\ncard with each pile. It is advisable to throw the cards all in one heap and drop the pack\nface up on them after the throw of the last card.\nFinally turn the chosen pile face up and show the four aces.\n129 KINGS AND ACES\nFour double faced cards —Kings on one side, Aces on the other —are required. Place\nthese cards in different parts of the pack but nearer the bottom than the top, with t he aces\nshowing with the faces of the other cards. Put the four genuine aces on the top of the\ndeck.\nThus prepared, show the pack face upwards. Remark that you will use the four Kings and\nthe four Aces and take out the real Kings and the prepared Aces, la ying them down face\nupwards. As you draw attention to these cards make the half -pass, facing the pack, and\nbringing the four genuine aces to the lower end of it. Very openly put the four Kings on\nthe top of the pack one by one. Put the pack down. Borrow a hat. Take the four Aces (the\ndouble faced cards) show them again and put them on the table covering them with the\nhat and turning them over in so doing. Pick up the pack, take off the four Kings and show\nthem once more, then replace them on the pack.\nOrde r the cards to change places. Holding the pack in your left hand drop the hand to\nyour side as you make a sweeping gesture towards the hat with your right hand. Bring\nyour left hand up with its back upwards, the pack will be turned. Take off the four aces\nand show them, then lift the hat and display the four Kings.\nUnder cover of this surprise right the pack, bringing the four unprepared Kings to the top.\nPut the double faced Kings on top for a second but immediately palm them off in your\nright hand. With that hand pick up the Aces and offer them and the pack for examination."

    "text": "By way of showing the higher flights to which the use of double cards may be put a\ndetailed description and explanation of this trick devised by David Devant, the great\nEnglish magician, follows:\nHaving invited a gentleman to occupy a chair facing the aud ience the performer begins\nby calling attention to a complete pack of cards displayed on a blackboard on an easel\nand also to a quantity of wide ribbon. He removes the two top rows of cards, half the\npack, drops them face downwards on a tray and asks the s pectator to take them, cut the\npack and put the halves together face to face and then to twist the center part of the\nribbon several times around the cards. He then gives the two end of the ribbon to two\nladies seated at the extreme right and left of the f ront row, forming as he explains \"The\nTriangle\" of which the spectator is the Apex. He removes the other half of the cards from\nthe easel and puts them face up on the tray.\nEach of the ladies is then asked to mentally select one card. This done he gathers up the\ncards and asks each lady to hold the packet in turn at the end of their ribbon and to wish\nthe card thought of to leave the packet and go to the gentleman's at the Apex. The ladies\n130 name their cards, the packet is spread out and the cards are no lon ger in it. The spectator\nunwinds the ribbon from his packet and in it he finds the two cards mentally selected.\nMETHOD: —A prepared pack, several yards of wide ribbon, an easel with a blackboard\nhaving four thin strips across it to hold the cards, a tray a nd a chair are required.\nOne half of the pack consists of double faced cards, the cards on the backs being\nduplicates of the unprepared half of the pack. The cards are placed on the easel so that the\ntwo top rows are the ordinary cards, the two bottom row s are the double faced cards.\nThey overlap a little so that they can be picked up quickly. The performer takes off the\ntwo top rows, which the spectator puts into a faced packet and then winds the center part\nof the ribbon round it. The two ends of the rib bon are handed to the two ladies. He takes\nthe two remaining rows from the easel and secretly turns them over in getting the tray,\nthus bringing the duplicates of the cards wrapped in the ribbon into view. Each lady in\nturn is asked to merely think of one of these cards. He gathers up the cards, has each lady\nhold them to her end of the ribbon and as the cards are named he secretly turns the packet\nagain. Naturally the two cards are no longer to be seen.

You may do some other trick and try for a run a fter it. Or you can hand the deck\nto someone else for further shuffling. Again if there is no run which is obviously the\nlongest there will always be at least two or three runs of about the same size. In this last\ncase use the run that is furthest to the r ight but until some practice has been had with the\nsystem it is safest to wait until one long run makes its appearance.\nLet us suppose that you have located a fairly long run. Fan the cards so that the spectator\nmust make a choice near the top or the bott om of the run, or you may force the top card\nof the run. If, however, the spectator takes a card from another part of the deck, maneuver\nso that it is replaced either inside the run or within a card or two of it. All you have to do\nthen is to remember the position of the card in relation to the run. For instance, third card\ninside the run on the left, or third card outside the run on the right, or as the case may be.\nClose the deck, square it very openly and have it cut as often as desired, with complete\ncuts of course.\nTo locate the card takes an instant only.

In case the spectator insists on\npushing his card in at some point remote from the run you will remember its location by\ncounting, not the single cards, but the groups of cards of the same color as the long run.

O. Williams\nThis combination of one-way cards with a prearrangement is strengthened by the fact that\na genuine shuffle is made, and yet the cards can be read while they are face down.\nTo prepare: first set the cards in one -way order, then separate the Diamonds and Clubs\nfrom the Spades and Hearts. Call the first packet A, and the second B. Arrange the A\ncards by putting the KD face up on the table, on it the 10C, 7D, 4C, AD, and so on, the\nsuits alternating and the values of the cards being three lower with each card.\nTurn the cards of packet B so that the indicators point in the opposite direction to those of\npacket A, then place the KH face up on the table, on it the 10S, and continue the series in\nthe same manner as in packet A. Place packet A on top of packet B and the deck is ready\nfor the trick.\nThe originator recommends that this prepared pack be substituted for the one in use after\nseveral tricks in which the cards have been well shuffled. Then by splitting the pack at\nthe lowest card of packet A, execute a riffle shuffle in a v ery open fashion, and have the\npack cut several times. The arrangement of each series is not interfered with, the cards\nfollow in regular order but the cards of one series are interspersed between cards of the\nother series. You know which series a card bel ongs to by the direction in which the\nindicators point.\nIn picking up the cards alter the last cut sight the bottom card, suppose it is the KD, if the\nindicator tells you that the top card belongs to me same series, you Know at once that the\ncard is the 10C, and that all the other cards facing in that direction follow in regular\norder. When the first card of series B appears a good plan is to take it off and hand it for\nexamination to prove there are no marks on the cards and sight it. You are then set for the\ncards of that series as well."

Now, at the psychological\nmoment say that you will demonstrate how \"some of the boys played Bridge the other\nnight. They were slightly tipsy, but one more so than the others ... in fact he was\npractically drunk and everybody thought he didn't know what was going on. So it came\nhis turn to deal and he shuffled the cards like this.\" At this point remove the deck from its\ncase and shuffle, acting the part of the drunk. \"Then he started to deal out fo ur hands, but\nhe got all mixed up and dealt to the wrong hands and everything, something like this.\"\nStill acting drunk, you deal the cards to South, East, North and West, sort of at random\ninstead of in correct rotation. Secretly though you manage to give each man his proper\ncards and deal to yourself all the cards with reversed backs. The patter and acting drunk\ncovers this operation perfectly and gets a laugh all the time. \"In the end everybody looked\nat their hands and would you believe it, the drunk had a grand slam.\" Turn over all the\nhands and show yours to be all Spades for the climax.\nINCOMPREHENDO"

This fact is fairly well known to\nmagicians.\nEmblem Backs: —A reversal of one of these cards is easily detected by the pos ition of\nthe handle bars or the pedals.\nWheel Backs: —In the center of the back there is a circular design in which are three\nwings. The difference will be noticed at once on reversing a card.\nLeague Backs: —This is the best for the purpose. The reversal o f a card alters the\nposition of one of the wings in the center design and the difference can be detected at a\ndistance of 15 to 20 feet.\nBank Note Back made by the Russell Playing Card Co. The clue lies in the small white\ndot in the border of small circle s surrounding the banknote Back.\nWith a fine pen and blue or red ink it is a very easy matter to make a slight alteration in\nany design of back that will be perfectly plain to you but unnoticeable to any one else.\nIn closing this treatment of the one way principle I quote from Theodore Annemann who\nhas devoted more time to, and has probably devised more subtle principles with cards,\nthan anyone else. He says, \"I have yet to find a card man using this principle (one way\ncards) who doesn't make apparent his scrutiny of the backs in waiting for a card to turn\nup.\"\n162 It follows from this you cannot disguise the fact that you are using one way cards from\nanyone who knows the principle even if he doesn't know the particular marking upon\nwhich you are relying, and you furthermore run the risk of putting even a layman wise to\nthe method. The best plan would seem to be to \"doctor\" your own cards, as suggested\nabove, making the tell -tale mark near the top left hand and bottom right hand corners and\nso plain to you tha t you can detect it easily with a very slight spreading of the cards. Such\na mark will never be noticed by a layman and will enable you to handle the cards without\na too noticeable and fatally suggestive scrutiny of the backs.\nMysteries Using Reversed “Ordinary” Cards"

Have a spectator cut off some ten or twelve cards and shuffle them. Tell him that\nwhen your back is turned he is t o lay out four cards face down in a row, look at one, note\nwhat it is, replace it face down and mix the four cards so that he himself will not know\nwhich one is his.\nTurn away with the remainder of the pack in your hands; turn these cards face up, reverse\nthe three top face -up cards, put one at the bottom, the next in amongst the others about\nor 10 cards down and turn the packet over. The cards will appear to be face up really the\n164 top and bottom cards and one card amongst them are face up, the rest face downwards.\nThe spectator having followed instructions, turn to him. Pick up one of the four cards and\ninsert it face down near the bottom of your packet —to all appearances the card goes in\nreversed, really it coincides with all your cards but the three. Do the same with two more\nbut put them in together and call attention to it, about the middle, and the last one put\nabout one -third down. These four cards now all face the same way as all the rest of your\ncards except the three. Turn the deck over, bringing the card that was reversed there to\nthe top, since its back shows the packet seems to be quite regular. With the left thumb\nriffle the top left corners of the cards until you reach the card you inserted in the packet\nreversed about 8 or 10 cards down, cut at that point, leaving it on the top, this brings two\nof the three reversed cards together and the third is on the top. Call attention to the rest of\nthe cards from which he chose four and tell him to pick them up. As he does so quietly\ndrop your left hand , turn it bringing the knuckles upwards thus turning the pack over.\nWith the right hand draw the pack away and put it on the table.\nHave the spectator place the remaining cards on the top and cut the cards. The trick is\ndone. You have already announced th at you will cause the chosen card to turn over, but\nwill leave the other three reversed. Have the card named and let the spectator hold the\npack. You utter the magic formula, or whatever hocus -pocus you affect, and the result\nfollows. He finds three cards reversed, two of them together, and the chosen card faces\nwith the rest of the deck.

Ease\nup the pressure of the thumb and it will be found that the reversed card and those below it\nwill fall. Complete the pass in the usual way and the reversed card will be on the bottom\nof the pack.\nIn doing the trick lift the pack in position for the Charlier pass, and make it, as you drape\nthe handkerchief over the cards.

Cards with white margins on the back must be used.\nTHE REVERSE \"COUNT -DOWN\" TRICK\nThis is one of the easiest as well as one of the most effective presentations of this often\nseen effect. The magician has a card selected from a group of cards cut from the top of\nthe deck. An elastic band is snapped around the performer's half of the deck and the\nselected card is returned to the top of the deck by slipping it under the elastic. Next the\nremainder of the cut is returned on top of the selected card and under the elastic. A\nspectator calls out any number, the cards are withdrawn one by one from the top of the\ndeck, and on the nu mber called being reached the selected card turns up. This is\nparticularly mystifying because the magician has made no apparent effort to manipulate\nthe deck, in fact the elastic seems to preclude any tampering.\nSECRET: —Before offering the deck to be cut the magician has reversed the bottom four\nor five cards. The spectator cuts from the top of the deck and holds the cut off portion in\nsuch a way that no one else knows the number of cards he has cut. While he is selecting a\ncard you very deliberately snap an elastic around the deck. Now secretly turn over the\ndeck to bring the reversed cards to the top, and offer the deck for the insertion of the\nselected card. Assist the spectator by lifting up the elastic. Now while he shuffles the\nremainder of his cut -off portion, secretly turn the deck over again so that when he returns\nthese cards they go on top of the original top of the deck, and not on top of his selected\ncard as he supposes. Call for any number and withdraw cards from the original top of the\ndeck to within one of the number decided upon. Fan these to show that the selected card\nis not among them, and under cover of the fan reverse the pack. The selected card is now\non top, and you can let anyone draw it off. While they are looking at the card, withdr aw\nthe elastic and reset the deck before offering it for examination."

The rubber band\nis snapped around the deck and the Aces are slid under it onto the top of the pack. Now\nsecretly reverse the deck so that the Aces are on bottom. Taking off the three top cards\n168 and calling them (Aces), they are laid on the table by the performer.

Place the cards one in front\nof the other in the right hand as you show them so that they remain in the same order.\nWhen you have shown 9 cards ask if one has been mentally selected, if so replace the\ncards on the top of the pack, but if not, put them on the bottom and continue in the same\nway with another set of 9 cards. If one is chosen mentally from these place them on top,\nif not, on the bottom, and continue until spectator says he has selected a card, and drop\nthat packet of 9 on top and false shuffle the pack.\nSay that you will use half the deck only and deal off 26 cards in three heaps and, since\nthere is a Joker in the pack, you will take one more card to make the heaps even .\nRemarking that it is necessary for you to know if the card thought of is in that half of the\npack, pick up the first pile of 9 sad show the cards, if it is there pick up the three heaps\nwith this one on top; if it is in the second put that on top, and if it is neither of the first\ntwo you know it must be in the third, so you say you Will just take a chance. False\nshuffle and again deal three piles telling the spectator to watch for his card and try to send\nyou the name mentally. Note the third card in eac h packet, one of them is the card\nthought of. With one or two leading questions you can ascertain the card and then name it\nin the hesitating way the mindreaders affect.\nBy having the row it is named, you know the card with certainty. In that case gather up\nthe packets with the one containing the chosen card in the middle and it will be the 12th\ncard down. Deal face up telling the spectator to think \"Stop\" when he sees his card. You\nstop at the 12th.\n181 FOUR TO ONE DETECTION\nAny one selects from his own shu ffled deck any 16 cards. Take them and deal as follows,\nface down:\n\nTurn your back and tell the spectator to turn up any card, look at it, turn it face down\nagain and leave it in the same place. This done you turn round and pick up all the cards in\nthe s ame row as his, shuffle them and let the spectator shuffle them. Have the spectator\nput his cards on top of yours. Shuffle all the other cards and put them on the packet\nalready made. Deal the cards as before face up.\nAsk the spectator which row his card is in. It will lie at 7, 8, 9, 10, or 11. There are\ntherefore 4 chances of success to one of failure. The selected card falls at 11 if it is left on\nthe face of his packet after the spectator shuffles; and if you have him shuffle with the\ncards face up he is not likely to leave it in that position."

The e ffect is that the performer\nappears to be able to divine the exact number of cards secretly moved from one end of a\nrow to the other, and is able to continue doing the trick ad lib. without rearranging the\ncards.\nTo prepare you place 11 cards in sequence from 10 to Ace with a Jack following the A,\nregardless of suits, on top of the pack. The J is to represent 0. Deal these cards face down\non the table from left to right thus:\n10. 9. 8. 7. 6. 5. 4. 3. 2. A. J.\nExplain that you will turn your back and any s pectator may move as many cards as he\npleases, one by one, from the right end of the row to the left but not more than 10. To\nillustrate this you move six cards from right to left. The cards will then lie thus:\n5. 4. 3. 2. A. J. 10. 9. 8. 7. 6.\nThe J has been brought to the sixth position from the right so that 6 will be your key\nnumber for the next move. Turn away and the spectator moves, say 2 cards from right to\nleft making the lay -out——\n186 7. 6. 8. 4. 8. 2. A. J. 10. 9. 8.\nTurning around you gaze intentl y at the spectator, announce that you have read his mind\nand to prove it you will turn up a card with the same number of spots on it as the number\nof cards he moved. Turn the 6th card, the two spot. For the next key card simply add 2 to\n6 which gives 8, th e present position of the J, therefore no matter what the number of\ncards moved the 8th card will give it by its number of spots. This may be continued\nindefinitely, whenever the number amounts to more than 11, subtract 11 and continue\nwith the remainder a s the key number. If the J turns up then no cards have been moved.\nAfter divining the number two or three times announce that you will give an illustration\nof the dominant power of your thought. Pick another spectator and tell him to think of\nany number b etween 1 and 10. Tell him that you have selected a number mentally and\nthat you will force him to choose the same one. To prove your assertion you take a slip of\npaper and Write, \"Turn over the .......... card,\" filling the blank\nspace with the key card c alculated for the next move. Put the paper down folded and lay\nthe pencil on it. \"There is my number,\" you say, \"Now please move the cards to the\nnumber you thought of\". He does so. reads the slip and turns the card showing that\nnumber of spots. Gather up the cards, mixing them up, replace them on the pack and\nshuffle.\nThe trick is very effective as it is but with the ability to make a false shuffle and false cuts\nit may be made into a little miracle. With the pack set up execute several false shuffles\nand cuts, then deal out five or six of the set cards. Make another fa lse shuffle and several\ncuts, then deal the rest to complete the row. Any suspicion that you may know the faces\nof the cards cannot then enter into the minds of your audience and the feat is thereby\nmade very much more effective."

You\nhave previously palmed t hese off and given the deck to someone to hold. Hand the other\ndeck to the medium and step into the audience without a word. The medium looks at the\nthree top cards in running through the deck and figures back three cards according to the\nsystem, picking o ut the duplicates of those originally selected.\nThis effect should be played up strong, and the cards drawn out one by one with great\n\"concentration.\" The wise ones will be fooled the most, for they are all looking for codes."

    "text": "For this trick you must make an impromptu set -up with 12 cards of any one suit, 6 at the\ntop and 6 at the bottom. To do this run through the pack to take out the Joker and seize\nthis opportunity to get se veral cards of one suit, say Hearts to the top and bottom of the\ndeck. Remarking that you have also to eliminate four other cards, take out one card of the\nsuit decided on, Hearts, and any three cards of other suits. The pretence of searching for\nspecial c ards covers the placing of the remainder of the Hearts in the required positions.\nLay the four discards and the Joker aside. Riffle shuffle without disturbing the 6 top and\nthe 6 bottom cards. Hand the pack to a spectator telling him to deal 6 cards in a r ow and\ncontinue dealing one card at a time on these in rotation. The result is that each pile has a\nHeart at the top and bottom.\nInstruct the spectator that, while your back is turned he is to take a card from the middle\nof any heap, note it, place it on top of any other heap and assemble the piles in any order\nhe pleases. Finally he is to write the name of the card on a slip, fold it and put it on the\ntable. Turn around and spread the pack face up on the table, run your hand over the line\ntelling him to t hink \"Stop\" when you reach his card. Take a mental note of the card\nbetween two Hearts but do not stop. Gather the pack and lay it aside, then pretend to get\nthe name of the card by putting your hand to his forehead. Name it in the usual piecemeal\nmanner. The slip is opened and your mindreading is verified.\n230 MEPHISTO'S MESSAGE\nBeforehand arrange 16 cards of mixed suits on the top of the deck as follows: 3, 2, court\ncard, 5; 2, court card, 5, 3; court card, 5, 3, 2; 5, 3, 2, court card. Note that these card s\nmake up 4 groups of 4 cards the spots on which, counting court cards as 2, amount to 12.\nCount to the 12th card from the bottom and write its name on a slip of paper and seal it in\nan envelope.\nThus prepared, have a spectator cut the pack in half. Tell him to deal the cards in the\nlower packet face down and count them, and then snap a rubber band around them and\nput the packet in his pocket. Next instruct him to deal from the upper packet 4 hands of\ncards each. It makes no difference whether he deals 4 cards at a time, or separately, but\nwhichever method he adopts, remark that you meant him to deal the other way but let it\ngo. Let him select any pile, and place his hand on it, while you pick up the other three and\nshuffle them back into the pack. The sp ectator counts the spots on the four chosen cards\nand gets the total 12. He then takes the packet from his pocket and counts down to the\n12th card and finds we will suppose, the Ace of Clubs. On opening the envelope he finds\nthis card named in your predict ion."

    "text": "Two packs are use d, one with blue backs, the other with red backs, and both having white\nborders around the back patterns. Remove from the blue deck the KS, AH, 10D, 3S, and\nput them on the top in that order followed by an indifferent card as the top card. Also take\nout th e 7C, and put is on the bottom. From the red deck take out the same cards making a\npacket of them in the same order, with an indifferent card on the top and the 7C as the\nbottom card, and place this packet of red cards at the bottom of the blue deck.\nTo p erform the trick, place the two packs on the table and force the red deck on a\nspectator using the usual equivoque. Ask him to shuffle his pack while you shuffle the\nblue deck. You can do this by a riffle shuffle without disturbing the top and bottom cards ,\nbut the cards must be well covered by the hands to avoid exposing the red backed cards\non the bottom. Secretly make a break with your right thumb at the inner end of your deck\nseparating the 6 red cards from the blue cards. Take the red deck from the spe ctator with\nyour left hand and put the two packs together for a moment pretending to judge the\nthickness of the pile to decide how many packets you should make. Really you let the\nred cards join the red deck at the top. Separate the two packs again and p lace them on the\ntable. Cut the blue deck into two packets and invite the spectator to do the same with the\nred deck. Again cut each of your piles in half, the spectator follows suit. We will call the\npiles A, B, C, D. In making the cuts see that the spect ator does exactly the same as you\ndo so that the resulting packets are opposite one another. In each case the arranged cards\nare on top of pile D. Turn the top cards of your four piles face up, spectator does the\nsame. Call attention to the fact that they are just any cards at all and have them all turned\ndown again. Now move the top cards of your four piles from one heap to another\napparently in a haphazard fashion, but in such a way that ultimately you have one of the\nfour cards, KS, AH, 10D, 3S, on top o f each heap. The spectator makes each move as you\ndo, so that the four duplicates in hip pack are brought to the same locations. The top cards\nare turned and shown to match, and are nut aside.\nThe 7C will be the bottom card of your packet A, while the red 7C is on the top of the\nspectator's heap D. Assemble the deck by placing D an C. DC on B and DCB on A, the\nspectator doing the same. Turn your pack face up showing the 7C, and tell the spectator\nto turn over the top card of his pack, and it also proves to be the 7C.\n235 TELEPATHIC CONTROL\nUnder the pretence of taking the Joker out of a well shuffled pack, rapidly memorize the\nfive bottom cards. The quickest and easiest way is to first take the values only, as for\ninstance 7, 5, Q, 9, 4, then memorize the sui ts in the same fashion. Riffle shuffle several\ntimes, but do not disturb these five bottom cards.\nHand the pack to a spectator and have him make several complete cuts. He then fans the\ndeck and hands you four cards as you call for them The first three car ds called are just\nindiffer ent ones, but are not among the four cards, name the bottom card of the five\nmemorized and have the deck cut at this point, thus bringing the other four cards to the\nbottom of the pack. Tell the spectator to deal the cards into f our face down heaps with the\nresult that you have the four memorized cards one at the top of each heap. Spectator\nchooses a heap and looks at the top card. You tell him to cut the packet, look at the card\ncut and tell you if it is odd or even, then you nam e the top card. This odd or even business\nis for misdirection only.\nThe other three cards can be read in the same way. Note: It is easier to have five cards set\nup in a formula you know by heart and add them to the bottom of the pack just before\nyou do the trick."

    "text": "EFFECT: —After shuffling and cutting the cards the performer instantly calls the number\nof cards in a packet cut off. After repeating this effect several times he divides the packet\ninto four portions and puts each packet in a different pocket. Any card called for it then\ninstantly produced.\nMETHOD: —The cards are arranged in four sections thu s:—\nNo. 1. AH, 2H, 3S, 4S, 5S, 6D, 7D, 8D, 9C, 10C, JC, QH, KH.\nNo. 2. AC, 2C, 3H, 4H, 5H, 6S, 7S, 8S, 9D, 10D, JD, QC, KC.\nNo. 3. AD, 2D, 3C, 4C, 5C, 6H, 7H, 8H, 9S, 10S, JS, QD, KD.\nNo. 4. AS, 2S, 3D, 4D, 5D, 6C, 7C, 8C, 9H, 10H, JH, QS, KS.\nRefer a lways to the first packet as the Heart packet; the second as the Club packet; the\nthird the Diamond packet and the fourth the Spade packet. Having the packets so\narranged face down, put No. 1 on No. 2, these two on No. 3, and these on No. 4. Thus\nassembled the top card will the AH and the bottom card the KS. The packets being in\nnumerical order (J counting 11, Q, 12 and K, 13), the value of the face card of the packet\ncut off will denote the number of cards in the packet, for instance, if the face card is a\n236 and the packet contains a few cards only their number is 7; if however there are obviously\nmore than 7 cards, simply add 13 and call 20 as the number of cards. Finally if you rut\nmore than half the pack you must add 26 to the value of the face card of t he cut.\nFor the second effect riffle the ends of the cards, locate the KH, (13th card) lift off packet\nNo. 1 and put it in your left aide coat pocket; riffle next to the KC and put packet No. 2 in\nyour right side coat pocket; divide the remainder at the K D and put No. 3 in right trousers\npocket and No. 4 in left trousers pocket. A very simple formula will enable you to find\nany card called for. Divide the numerical value of the card by three and the answer,\nignoring the remainder if any, will designate the pocket containing the card. For example\nthe 7H is called for. Three goes into seven twice, so 2 therefore is the key number. The\nsuit being Hearts refer to the Heart pocket (left side coat pocket) and count 2. counting\nthe right coat pocket 1 and the righ t trousers pocket 2; the required card must therefore be\nin the right trousers pocket and as the packet is in numerical order it must be the 7th card.\nAgain suppose the JC is called for; 3 into 11 gives 3 for the answer.\nThe suit being Clubs, refer to th e Club packet in the right coat pocket and count 3 from it\nin the same direction as given in the first example, bringing you to the left coat pocket in\nwhich the card lies. Since the Ace and the Two cannot be divided by 3, they will be found\nin the pocket of the suit called.\nPlace the packets in the pockets with the faces outwards. When a card is brought out, do\nnot remove it singly, count to the card, square the others behind it and bring them all out\nas one card, then replace them in the pocket so that t he order of each packet is not\ndisturbed."

    "text": "A little story based on the deck of cards. First, let me introduce our hero, Diamond Jack\n(JD). No relation to Diamond Joe. Jack was just twenty -six (2S 6S), handsome, a regular\nKing of Hearts (KH). He had been an Ace (AD) in the war, but now he was poor. In fact,\nhe had not been flush (flush in Spades, K -Q-J-10-9) for a long time. He often felt blue\n(Show blue back of card) because he belonged to only one club (AC) while his friends\nbelonged to two or three (2C and 3C). But Jack was proud; his hands (two fans of cards)\nhad never turned a spade (AS).\nOne day at seven (7S) he had a date with a swell queen (QD). She was a 'pip' (snap spot\nof Q), but when he arrived she was not on deck (Look for Q on top of deck). \"That is a\nnasty cut,\" (cut the cards) said Jack. So he picked up another blonde queen (Pick up QH\nfrom table) and at e (8S) with her. The head -waiter said he had a full -house (8H, 8D, 8C,\n3H and 3D), but he seated them anyway, as head -waiters will. And say, she ate (8H) and\nate (8D) and ate (8C). She ordered several club steaks (Throw down 8C) and everything\non the card (Hold up 3H, back to them). The waiter brought tray (3H) after tray (3D) of\nfood.\nBut finally as she was finishing off with a fancy, cherry -colored pear (7H and 7D), Jack\nrealized he had only a ten and a five (10D and 5D). Luckily the bill was only thirte en\nspots (10C and 3S), but when the waiter added two more (Deal last two cards on table),\nJack asked, \"What for?\" (4S).\n\"My tip,\" said the dirty knave (JC).\n\"The deuce (2D) you say,\" said Jack. \"I don't mind forking (4C KC) over ten per cent\n(10H), but t his is outrageous.\"\nHere is where the queen dropped out of sight (Drop QH on floor).\nThen the waiter spotted the diamonds (6D) on Jack's cravat and snatched for them. Jack\npasted a grand slam in his fifth rib near the heart (5H). \"Nein, Nein, Nein,\" (9D, 9C, 9H)\ncry the German waiters excitedly. But the manager sicks (6H) the cops on them. In fact,\nhe called out half of the force (4H 4D). In the shuffle (Shuffle cards on table) that\nfollowed, Jack fanned a few (fan), but he had the whole pack after him, and finally six or\nseven cubs (6C 7C) descended at once. His mind went blank (blank card ).\nWhen he awoke he was facing Judge King (KD). A lawyer was appointed to handle the\ncase (Pick up card case from table). \"Your name,\" said the Judge.\n238 \"Diamond Jack,\" (JD) shouted our hero.\n\"Not so much snap,\" (snap the cards) said the Judge.\nJust then Jack saw his old sweetheart, Mary McClub (QC) from Oireland, who was acting\nas court stenographer.\n\"Your Honor, I was almost robbed by a knave (JH), a highjacker (Hold JH above your\nhead), but this little girl will testify to my character.\"\n\"Let me get this straight\" (K-Q-J-10-9) of S, same as used before) said Judge King.\n\"I love her with an aching heart,\" (AD, KD, AH) said Jack.\n\"So hearts (AH) are trumps?\" asked the Judge.\n\"I'm no Joker,\" (Joker) said Jack.\n\"So you want to marry her?\" \"I do,\" said Jack, handing over a solitaire (AD).\n\"Accept my stamp of approval,\" (Snap revenue stamp on card -case) finished the Judge.\nAnd so they became two of a kind (5S and 5C), two minds with but a single thought, two\nhearts (2H) that beat as one (AH).

    "text": "Briefly the pack is used thus: After giving the cards a riffle shuffle, which does not\ndisturb the arrangement, square the deck and hold it face down with the outer end slightly\nraised towards the spectators. Slowly ruffle the cards by placing the tip of the right fore -\nfinger on the outer edges of the cards, bend the pack slightly upwards and release the\ncards rather slowly, every card will be seen to be different. The short cards do\n241 not appear since the cards fall in pairs. Lowering the pack, again ruffle the cards and\ninvite a spectator to insert his finger tip, (or the blade of a knife) at any point he desires.\nNo matter where he does this his finger will rest on the back of o ne of the short cards.\nDivide the pack at this point, let the spectator take out that card and the force is made.\nIt will be noted that the bottom card of the portion lifted off with the right hand is an\nindifferent card as is also the top card of the lef t hand portion after the card has been\nwithdrawn, by showing these cards the apparent fairness of the choice is established.\nFrom this simple principle many astonishing effects have been developed and it is safe to\nsay that there are possibilities of further card miracles waiting to be evolved by ingenious\nminds.\nThe greatest effect is obtained by switching a deck that has been used for several tricks,\nin the course of which the spectators have freely handled and shuffled the cards, for a\nSvengali deck. Results can then be obtained which to the layman appear miraculous. In\nthe following pages a method will be found for secretly exchanging the duplicate cards\nfor 26 indifferent cards which, with the other 26 cards of the Svengali deck make up a\ncomplete deck that can be freely handled and examined by the spectators, thus leaving no\nclue to the feats performed.\nBesides the rufflin g method of showing all the cards different you may cut small packets\nfrom the top laying them down face up. Every face card will be different since you can\nonly cut at a long card. Assemble the pack again and have it cut several times. This is a\nvery conv incing method.\nIn addition to the thrusting of a finger or knife blade into the pack for the choice of a\ncard, you may cut the pack by the ends into several piles and have any one of them\nchosen. The top card of the heap chosen is lifted off by the specta tor.\nA second method of showing all the cards different is to hold the pack upright in the right\nhand, thumb at the top, fingers at the bottom, release the cards slowly from the thumb and\nthey will fall forward in pairs, every card showing a different fac e. This is more\nconvincing than the ruffle."

    "text": "Before explaining some of the special tricks that have been devised for the use of this\npack and to enable the reader to become used to the proper handling of the pack, some of\nthe simpler feats will be described first.\n1. Show the cards all different by ruffling them, riffle shuffle and make a series of cuts\neach time showing a different card on the face of the right hand portion. Invite a spectator\nto insert his forefinger tip at any point he d esires. Let him remove the card, note it and\nyou read his mind by naming the card. Casually show the bottom card of those in your\n242 right hand, that is the cards above the one he removed and also the top card of the portion\nin your left hand.\n2. Have the ca rd replaced in the same position and drop the right hand portion on top.\nSquare the pack and cut several times to make the impression that the card is lost in the\ndeck. Announce that you will place the cards, one by one, face down on the table and\ninvite t he spectator to call \"Stop\" at any time he wishes. Seeing that cutting the cards has\nleft one of the shorts on the top, it follows that you have only to stop on any odd number\nto have a duplicate of the selected card in your hand. If, however, the spectato r calls on\nan even card simply place it on top of the cards already on the table and say, \"And the\nvery next card will be your card.\" Turn the next card and show it, then place it on top of\nthe pile on the table, pick up the pile, being careful not to expo se the bottom card, and\nplace it on top of the remainder in your left hand.\n8. Hand the top card, the one already chosen and ask the spectator to place the tip of his\nforefinger on its back and hold it there for a few seconds, then placing your left hand with\nthe pack behind your back, you take the card in your right hand and say you will push it\ninto the pack behind your back so that no one can possibly know just what position it will\noccupy. Pretend to do this but simply put the card on the top of the pa ck. Bring the pack\nforward and again show that every card is different by making a series of cuts. Then\nruffle the cards inviting the spectator to insert his finger tip anywhere he likes. He does\nthis and you lift off the portion above his finger, while he names the card, (you have\nforgotten what it was?). Ask him to draw out the card and turn it over —and he finds it's\nhis card. Again show that the card preceding it and the card following it are quite\ndifferent cards.\n4. The above effects may very well fol low one another but, of course, you cannot keep on\nusing the same forced card indefinitely.\nA pretended prediction trick can be easily worked with the Svengali deck. After showing\nthe cards all different and riffle shuffling the pack, you write the name o f the force card\non a slip of paper, fold it, and hand it to a spectator to hold. Have a spectator select a card\nas above with his finger tip, or a knife blade, as you ruffle the cards, or by his making a\nsimple cut. Lay the card face down on the table, ha ve the spectator read your prediction\nthen let him turn the card over.\n6. Naturally the use of this pack makes a sure -fire force. It can be used to force two cards\nby having two sets of 13 similar cards instead of the usual 26. However, you should be\nprepared to make a switch to an unprepared deck after the force. Various methods for\neffecting this will be explained here since they are indispensable if you wish to do a\nseries of tricks with Svengali decks. It is hardly necessary to point out that the back\npatterns of all the packs must be the same.\n243 SWITCHING PACKS\n1. Pack in right hip pocket. Give some reason for putting the pack behind your back.\nHave it in your left hand, as the right hand goes to the back, pull out the pack from the\nhip pocket, change the decks and slip that just taken from the left hand into the right hip\npocket. A slight turn to the right should be made to cover the right hand going to the\npocket. The belt may be used in the same way.\n2. Place duplicate pack in upper left vest pocket . When you turn away on some pretext,\ndrop the pack in use from the left hand into your inside breast pocket while the right hand\ntakes the duplicate pack from the vest pocket and put it into your left hand. Be careful to\nkeep the elbows pressed to your si des as the change is made.\n3. Duplicate pack is on your table covered with a handkerchief. Pretend to put down the\npack in use as you pick up the handkerchief; in reality keep the pack in your hand,\ncovered with the handkerchief, and the pack on the table appears to be the one put down.\nUse the handkerchief and put it and the pack in your pocket.\n4. A bold method suitable for the smaller sized bridge decks is to have the duplicate pack\nin your right hand trousers pocket. Apparently put the pack in your le ft hand, palming it\nin the right. Toss the cards from the left hand to the spectators, thrust right hand into the\ntrousers pocket, leave the palmed pack and bring out the duplicate.\n5. On a chair seat have several sheets of paper and under them the duplic ate pack. With\nthe pack in your right hand lift up the sheets, drop the pack and take up the duplicate.\nThis is a useful method in any trick such as the card stabbing in which the pack is\nwrapped in paper.\n6. With the duplicate pack in its case in your ri ght hand outside coat pocket, replace the\npack in use in its ease as if you had finished. Put it in your coat pocket, then decide to do\none more trick and bring out the other case.\n7. A standard method for a set performance is the use of a card servante o n the back of a\nchair. The switch is simply done by dropping one pack into the bag of the servante and\ngripping the duplicate from its clip as you place a chair for a spectator to sit on facing the\naudience.\nOther methods will be given in the special sect ion devoted to sleights."

    "text": "It is not certainly known who devised this variation of the combination of long and short\ncards, but the title, \"Mene, Tekel,\" was first applied to it by the late W. D. Leroy, the well\nknown magical dealer of Boston. Like the Sv engali deck it consists of 26 ordinary cards\nand 26 short cards but instead of the short cards being all of the same suit and value, they\nalso are all different, each short card being of the same suit and value as its neighboring\nordinary card so that the pack consists of 26 pairs of cards, one short and one ordinary\ncard of the same suit and value in each pair.\nTo construct such a deck obtain two packs of cards, with the same back patterns, the\ncards preferably being thin and pliable and not too slippery. Thoroughly shuffle one pack\nand count off 26 cards. Then from the second pack take 26 cards of the same\ndenomination as in the first and arrange them in the same order. You will then have two\npackets of cards exactly similar. From the ends of one set shav e off about 1/16 of an inch.\nThis may be done with a photo -print trimmer, or, better still, a book -binder's guillotine if\nyou have access to one. Having thus shortened one set of card, arrange the whole 52 in\npairs, the short card being the top card of eac h pair, and the Mene Tekel pack is set up.\nTo show the cards apparently all different riffle the ends slowly before the audience, the\nfaces of the ordinary cards only will show up. Or, you may hold the pack upright, thumb\nat the top end, and let the cards fall forward on to the left hand, again showing only the\nfaces of the ordinary cards. The pack may be riffle shuffled without disarranging the\ncards. To do this, square up the pack by tapping one end on the table to settle the short\ncards, then while the pack is on end, divide it about in half so that a short card is on the\ntop of the lower portion. Riffle the two halves one into the other in the usual way, the\ncards will fall in pairs and the sequence of the prepared pack is not destroyed. The pairs\nwill occupy different positions, but each pair will be intact. In similar fashion the pack\ncan be cut indefinitely with complete cuts without separating the pairs, since the cut will\nalways be made at one of the ordinary cards.\n252 To illustrate the use of the dec k for controlling a freely chosen card slowly riffle it and\nrequest a spectator to insert his forefinger, or a paper knife, anywhere he pleases and take\nthe card next below his finger or the knife. In every case that card will be a short card and\nthe next card (ordinary card) will be the duplicate of the one chosen. As the spectator\ntakes the card raise the portion in the right hand and separate the hands a little, then\ncasually place the two portions of the pack together but put the cards in the left hand on\ntop of those in the right hand. This departure from the regular way of assembling the pack\nwill never be noticed, however, if it is preferred you may openly cut at the point from\nwhich the card was removed. The result is that you now have on the top of the pack the\nduplicate of the card chosen. The card may then be dealt with in any of the following\nways.\n1. The spectator, having noted his card, replaces it in any part of the pack which you at\nonce square up very openly. Request him to blow on the top c ard, name the card he drew,\nand turn the top card, it is his card. If it is desired to repeat the trick you will have to find\nthe odd one and again bring it on top of its duplicate.\n2. The duplicate may be revealed by holding the pack a short distance abo ve the table,\nsecretly push the card a little off the pack sideways, and the action of dropping the pack\nwill cause the card to turn over and appear face up.\n3. The card may be forced right out of the pack and passed through the table. To do this\nsecretly wet the back of your right hand. Show the spectator how you wish him to apply\npressure. Put the back of your right hand right on top of the pack and your left hand palm\ndownwards on that. Press down firmly and the top card will adhere to the back of your\nright hand, which you pass under the table top. The spectator places his hands on the pack\nin the same way and presses firmly. Have the card named and produce it from under the\ntable.\n4. As the spectator notes his card secretly glimpse the top card. Tell him to concentrate\nhis thoughts on the name of his card and you read his mind in the usual fashion first\ngetting the color of his card, then the suit and finally the value. By having the card\nreturned to the top the pack will be in order for another demons tration.\n5. After the card has been selected and the shift made bringing the duplicate to the top,\nput the pack in your left outside coat pocket for a moment thumbing off the top card and\nleaving it in the pocket. Bring the pack out again under pretence o f having forgotten to\nhave the chosen card replaced. Have it pushed into the pack and at once place the pack in\nyour right hand pocket. Have the card named and orde r it to pass across into the left\npocket, from which you produce it.\n6. After the return of the card to the middle, square up the cards very openly, then hold\nthe pack upright in your right hand, face of the bottom card towards the spectators. Order\nthe card to rise and push up the top duplicate card with tips of the first and second\nfingers. It will appear to rise from the middle of the deck.\n253 CONTROLLING SEVERAL CARDS\nBring the duplicate of the first card to the top as already explained, leave the chosen card\nin the first spectator's hands and go to a second person. When he draws a card do not pass\nthe upper portion to the bottom as before, simply lower the top packet t o the side of the\nlower one and with the thumb of the left hand push the top card of the lower on top of the\nright hand packet and replace this packet on top. Thus the duplicate of the second\nspectator's card is now on top of the pack, and the first person 's duplicate card is the\nsecond card. You follow exactly the same process for as many cards as you wish to have\nchosen so that finally you have duplicates of all the cards on the top of the pack, but you\nmust remember that these are in the reverse order to that in which the short cards were\ndrawn."

The\nprincipl e is simple in the extreme, the cards taper at the ends, that is one end of each card\nis slightly narrower than the other. It follows that if a card is turned end for end it can be\ninstantly found because of the projection of its broad end amongst the narr ow ends of the\nother cards.\nThe use of this expedient is too often condemned by unthinking magicians as being of a\nchildish nature and of use only to those to whom the difficulties of the more pretentious\nand elaborate methods of sleight of hand are insur mountable. But any road that leads to\nthe desired result, that of deceiving your audience, is as good as any other, and Where\nsimplicity is achieved, it may be much better. After all the deception of your audience is\nyour ultimate goal. Complication for th e sake of being complicated is a fool's trick and is\nnot the same thing as being clever. In ordinary life, in which conjuring has no part, it is\ncalled by the less attractive name of self conceit.\nThe reason generally given for not using the stripper deck is that it is so widely known,\neven to the average school boy, which may be true but that does not in itself render the\nprinciple useless. One might almost as well say that since practically every one knows\nthere is such a thing as palming, therefore the magician should not use his hands. The\nvalue of an accessory depends largely upon the skill and subtlety, with which it is used. A\nsimple device in one person's hands may become a stroke of genius in those of another.\nThe ordinary straightforward use of th e stripper cards, with the cards coarsely cut does\ncertainly reduce the pack almost to the level of schoolboy conjuring. But a well cut deck,\nsuch as a professional would insist on, should not betray the secret even under a free\nhandling by the spectator.\n257 The first thing to be mastered is to be able to turn the deck imperceptibly for the return of\nthe chosen card. To begin with, have the narrow ends nearest your body so that when the\nchosen card is returned to the reversed deck the projecting sides will be at the inner end.\nTo effect this reverse, spread the pack in a wide fan in the left hand from left to right. As\nsoon as a card is withdrawn close the fan by placing your right hand on the left side of the\nfan and closing the pack towards the right, thus b ringing the narrow end pointing to the\nleft and the wide end to the right. Retain hold of the cards with the thumb and fingers of\neach hand at the ends.\nIf the spectator, has taken a card by its wide end and has not changed his hold, you offer\nthe deck to him in your right hand, slightly spreading it with the thumb and fingers.\nSquare the deck and the wide end of the chosen card is at the inner end. It may happen\nthat the spectator will turn the card round himself in showing it to another spectator, in\nthat case you offer the pack for its return with your left hand again slightly spreading it\nfanwise, this time with the left thumb and fingers. By holding the pack in the position\nnamed, the necessary turn is half made and can be imperceptibly completed by ta king the\ncards in the right hand for the return of a card, or nullified by taking them with the left\nhand.\nAnother very good method is to square the deck and hold it by the ends in the right hand,\nfingers on the outer wide end, thumb on the inner narrow e nd, square the sides of the\npack with the left thumb and fingers, the left forefinger curled up under the pack, and the\nright forefinger curled in on the top. Now it is an easy matter to riffle either end of the\ndeck for the return of the card. If the spec tator has not turned his card, remove your left\nhand from the pack and with it pull the right sleeve a little, at the same time turning the\nright palm upwards bringing the pack upright, right thumb on the narrow ends. Bring the\nleft hand against the face o f the deck and riffle with the thumb for the return of the\nselected card. If however, the spectator has turned his card, simply riffle the wide ends\nwith the tip of the right second fingers.\nThese two methods obviate the necessity for any palpably awkward reversing of the pack\nand will pass without notice even by those who know something about the stripper\nprinciple.\nThe latest and best method for the return of a card to a stripper deck is of comparatively\nrecent introduction and is calculated to deceive even an expert if he is unacquainted with\nthe procedure. Before offering the pack for the choice of a card, secretly turn half the\ndeck, so that the upper half of the cards have their narrow ends pointing outwards, the\nlower half has its wide ends pointing inwards. Allow a card to be selected freely from\neither half of the deck, but have it returned to the other half. Or if the card itself is turned\nby accident or design see that it is pushed back amongst the cards it was taken from.\nSquare up the cards, cu t at the projecting end of the lower wide cards and lift off the\nupper portion with the right hand, thumb on the inner end, fingers at the outer end, grip\nthe lower portion in the same way, thumb on the inner end, fingers on the outer end, turn\nthe hands i n the opposite directions bringing the thumbs together and riffle shuffle the\n258 cards by the ends. The result is that all the narrow ends and all the wide ends are brought\ntogether, leaving the chosen card the only one reversed.\nSome practice should be give n to stripping the cards apart after some have been reversed.\nThis should be done so neatly that the move should pass for an ordinary cut. It is only\nnecessary to hold the pack rather loosely and quite flat when it will be found\ncomparatively easy to separ ate them with one quick movement. An illustration of the\nsubtle use of a stripper deck in presenting a series of tricks depending on prearranged\ncards follows. The main thing in such effects is to convince your audience that the cards\nare honestly shuffled and therefore thoroughly well mixed, this can be done by using\nstrippers. Simply cut the arranged deck for a riffle shuffle, turning one packet endways.\nThe result will be a thorough mixing of the cards and this will be recognized by the\nonlookers; but by simply stripping the two sections apart under cover of a pretended cut,\nas explained and dropping one portion on the other, you have the cards in the same order\nas before. This subtle process is calculated to allay all suspicion as to the pack being\narran ged in any way and is therefore, invaluable in all such tricks.\nAnother practically unknown method of reversing the deck for the return of a card is to\nspread the cards on the table for the selection of a card. As soon as one has been\nwithdrawn pick up th e pack with the right hand between the fingers at the outer end and\nthe thumb at the inner end. In the course of some remark, such as asking the spectator to\nremember the card, turn the right hand palm upwards bringing the pack upright, then take\nit by the sides in the left hand turning it face down and execute an overhand shuffle. The\npack is reversed. Spread it on the table again and have the card pushed in the spread.\nGather the cards once more and again shuffle overhand. Nothing could appear to be\nfairer."

    "text": "In his book Mr. Gravatt writes as follows:\n\"It is sometimes desirable to get rid of certain selected cards entirely so that at the\nconclusion of the effect the reproduced cards m ay be shown to have actually left the\npack. This can only be achieved with an ordinary deck by dint of considerable skill and\nmaneuvering and keeping track of the cards by means of the pass, slip, false shuffling,\netc., all of which call for no common degr ee of skill in card manipulation. With the aid of\na stripper deck the thing becomes a simple job, it being perfectly easy to extract say half a\ndozen cards with one swift movement and either dispose of them entirely, or else bring\nthem all together at the top or bottom of the pack for future manipulation. Since this can\nbe accomplished even after a genuine shuffle, it serves the purpose better than the\nelaborate methods. Especially until the performer's skill will permit him to be clever for\nthe somewhat du bious satisfaction of being clever.\nWhen it is a ease of forcing a card, or several cards, it is a matter of anxiety to many to be\nable to handle the pack naturally and yet not lose sight of their force cards whilst casually\nshuffling the pack. More than one ambitious but nervous amateur has accidentally\nshuffled in the very cards they intended to force, and must restore matters as best they\ncan. The stripper deck always allows you to do a perfectly genuine overhand shuffle, or,\nfor that matter any other kind, yet you have your forcing cards ready at any time.\nTo the performer to whom neat handling of cards is not second nature, it is not so easy to\nraise two or more cards together and handle as one card, a thing which is often necessary\nin certain kinds of tricks. There are innumerable perfo rmers who can silently and quickly\ncount with accuracy any desired number of cards by merely running the thumb over the\nend of the pack. There are, on the other hand, any number to whom such a feat would\npresent insuperable difficulties and who, faced with such a proposition before an actual\naudience, would end by balling up the entire trick from sheer nervousness. If the required\ncards are counted off and reversed in one clump to start with, they may be found and\nbrought to the top at any time and the proj ecting edge allows the performer to lift the\ndesired number whether it be 2, or 20, without a glance at the cards.\nOne reversed card in the pack will form a key at which, after a series of cuts, the pack\nmay be given a final cut to restore it to the origi nal condition before it was cut at all. A\nreversed card serves also to mark off any desired number of cards to be palmed off the\npack and added to others, such as the cards to the pocket, etc. The performer is able to\nsecure the exact number quite automati cally.\"\n273 It has been my experience gained through a long period of intimate connection with\nmagic and magicians, professional, amateur and would -be, that without a certain degree\nof mastery of the fundamental sleights no one can present even the simplest o f the so -\ncalled self working feats with any degree of satisfaction to himself or his audience. Tricks\ndo not work themselves and there is practically not a trick in the whole range of magic\nthat does not depend upon the performer to be really effective. Th is is especially the case\nwith card tricks. There are, of course, numerous tricks which are really only puzzles, such\nas those depending on numerical calculations. The interminable counting and dealing in\nsuch tricks make them utterly useless for these day s. Any performer attempting the\npresentation of such feats would find his audience bored to tears before he was through\nwith the first one and if he attempted to continue with others would find himself playing\nto empty benches.\nOn the other hand with a fa ir degree of skill the most banal effect can be transformed into\na striking feat. With regard to the use of strippers it is easy to say that \"with one swift\nmovement\" any number of cards can be extracted from the pack and disposed of, but that\ndoes not hel p the would -be magician towards his one end, the deception of his audience,\nsince that \"swift movement\" and the disposal of the cards would be perfectly palpable to\nonlookers. My conclusion is this, to any one with the few indispensable sleights at\ncommand the stripper pack is a very valuable accessory but to attempt to depend upon it\nsolely will lead to disaster.\nTo acquire the necessary degree of skill does not require any great amount of application.\nIn the older text books great stress was laid upon th e Pass. One hour a day for a period of\nthree months was said to be necessary to get a working acquaintance with it. Modern\ningenuity has devised other methods of attaining the result in far easier ways and the\nsame thing applies to the other necessary slei ghts. I will undertake to teach any person\nwho can handle cards sufficiently well to shuffle a pack overhand fashion neatly, the half\ndozen indispensable sleights in five lessons of an hour's duration each.\nI do not mean that in that time any one could be come a skilled sleight of hand performer,\nbut I do maintain that sufficient skill would be acquired to enable one to present card\ntricks capably and with the necessary confidence."

    "text": "While the principle of stripping the ends of cards has been known and used by gamblers\nfor generations and was certainly originated for the purpose of cheating at cards it has\nremained practically unknown to magicians generally speaking. This is rather a curious\nfact since there are many fine effects possible only with end strippers while everything\nthat can be done with the side strippers can also be done with the end variety. Again the\ncards can be so finely cut that detection is practically impossible and such cards can be\nfreely used even with those that know al l about side strippers without arousing suspicion.\nWith the cards all set the one way the various methods for getting a chosen card reversed\nin the pack which have already been explained for the side strippers, can be brought into\n274 play. When the card has been reversed, or the deck reversed, which comes to the same\nthing, the projecting edge can be detected instantly in the mere act of squaring the deck\nwith the thumb on one end and the fingers on the other. It is an easy matter then to make\na break under t he card and make the pass bringing it to the bottom, or to break the pack at\nthat point and execute a riffle shuffle bringing the card to the bottom; or again to secure\nthe card in the right hand by means of the side palm; or simplest of all to make a regu lar\noverhand shuffle, the projecting edge making the reversed card cling to the fingers so that\nit can he put at the top or bottom as the last movement in the shuffle.\nAll the tricks for which side strippers are generally used can be done with the end\nstrippers. As for the special effects which can only be done with the end strippers space\nwill permit of the explanation of but a few of them. The reader will no doubt find out\nnovel applications of the principle for himself.\nA \"STOP\" DISCOVERY\nAfter the pa ck has been shuffled by a spectator, secretly reverse one card and have it near\nthe middle. Allow the free selection of a card. After the spectator has noted it cut the deck\nby the ends at the reversed card and have the chosen card replaced at that point, replace\nthe cut and square up very openly. Make a partial shuffle bringing the reversed card and\nthe card below it, the chosen card, to a position about one -third of the pack from the top.\nHold the deck by the ends and drop small packets of cards from the bottom in different\nplaces on the table telling the spectator to call \"Stop\" whenever he pleases. When he does\ncall drop all the cards below the reversed card. Have him name his card and turn the top\ncard of the last packet.\nThe trick may be repeated with added effect. When \"Stop\" has been called palm the top\ncard of the last packet and turn over the next, showing it but not looking at the card\nyourself. Turn it down and replace the palmed card on top. When the spectator says you\nhave shown the wrong card, affect incredulity and work the argument up. Finally invite\nhim to turn the card up himself. Before the shock of the surprise has passed it is well to\nassemble the pack, losing the first card shown amongst the others."

T he\nresult is that you have the black and red cards alternately throughout the deck all the\ncards of one color being reversed. This is the simplest way of making such an\narrangement, the whole action taking a few seconds only.\n275 Now with a red card on the bo ttom if you riffle the top ends of the cards at one corner red\ncards only will show, then by slipping the top black card to the bottom and riffling by the\ncorner, black cards only will be visible. The principle is exactly the same as with the\nSvengali or M ene Tekel decks the short cards do not appear.\nAgain by taking two decks, one with a red back, the other with a blue back and using the\nred cards with red backs and the blue cards with blue backs, and arranging them as above,\nyou can show all red faces an d turning the pack over show all red backs. Then by slipping\nthe top card to the bottom and riffling on the opposite corner show all black faces and\nfollow that by showing all blue backs.\nBy applying the principle of roughening the backs (see Svengali sec tion) and then\narranging the cards in pairs one red, one black, with the backs together, and also carrying\nout the reverse stripper arrangement as above for each color you can not only show all\nred and all black by riffling but also by fanning cards.\nProp erly introduced, that is by exchanging the pack that has been freely handled by the\nspectators, these results will be incomprehensible, even startling, to the layman and\nindeed to the average magician."

A mentally selected card\nis removed by a spectator and is found to have become red backed in his own hands.\nKnockout number two comes when he discovers that the whole deck has turned red\nbacked. He replaces his card without your seeing it and as soon as he names it you spell\nout its name, re moving a card for each letter and turning it up on the last one. The pack is\nnow cut in two portions and a card selected from one of them vanishes and reappears in\nthe other.\nBicycle cards, whose backs have white margins, are most suitable. From a red bac ked\npack remove these cards: 2, 3, 7, 8, Q, of Clubs; 4, 6, 9, J, K, of Hearts and Spades. Cut a\nnarrow strip from the ends of these and glue each to the back of a card taken from a blue\nbacked deck being sure that none of these red backed cards are duplic ated by the blues.\nLay the double cards out face up, glued ends all one way. Now from a second red deck\nremove the duplicates of the 15 named above. Cut them short and smooth their cut\ncorners with sandpaper. Lay them out face up in the same order as the r ear ones of the\nglued pairs already laid out.\nTo assemble: On the first single card place the 8th double one, then the second single, 9th\ndouble, 3rd single, 10th double, etc., to the 9th single on which goes the 1st double, 10th\nsingle, 2nd double etc., until all are picked up. The duplicate of any rear card of a glued\npair is thus about half the pack removed from it, the deck having been assembled face up,\n283 and all glued ends the one way. Turn the pack face down and place on it an indifferent\nblue backed card.\nHold the pack face down, glued ends inwards and with the other hand riffle the free ends,\nfrom back towards face of deck. Do not call attention to it but every one will notice that\nall backs show blue. Raise the pack vertically, so that it faces the company and freely\nshow the blue backed card at the back, transfer it to the face of the deck. Riffl e the free\nends from the back towards the face, or fan the cards, the faces now showing, owing to\nthe upright position of the pack. Demonstrating that the cards are all different, have a\nparty m entally select a card as you riffl e them. As he can only see the faces of the short\nrear cards of the glued cards, his choice is limited to them.\nFan the deck requesting the party to remove his card. Naturally he rem oves its single\nduplicate and his free handling of it is what makes this so convincing. Square the pack\nand turn it face down, concealing its back for the present. Tell him to return his card. He\nturns it face down to do so and discovers it is red backed. Before he recovers you begin\nfanning the pack from the left hand to the right, counting as you do so. The whole pack is\nnow red backed.\nWhen you have counted 11 cards of the fan into the right hand, have him insert his card\nthere, and continue spreading t he cards, being careful not to expose the single blue backer\nat the deck's face. Close the pack and have him name his card. Then deal a card at a time\non the table for each letter of its name, as \"DEUCE OF CLUBS,\" and turn up the last\ncard.\nIt is his card. This is because each of the 15 cards he could choose all spell with\nletters.\nAs your right hand turns the card up your left hand slips the blue back card at pack's face\ninto left side coat pocket. Fan the pack until you feel two adjacen t double cards and insert\nhis between them, where is originally came from. Replace the spelt off cards on the pack\none at a time to restore the original order.\nFan the deck to show there are no duplicates, then cut it into two heaps. Riffle the end of\nthe smaller heap so that only the rear cards of the glued pairs can be seen. The spectator\nmentally selects any one save the heap's face card. Riffle the other heap similarly to show\nhis card isn't there. Now fan the first heap showing each card separately. H is card has\ngone.

To prepare for the trick sort out the two packs,\nseparate into odd and even cards, counting Jacks and Kin gs odd, Queens even.

When you turn your back so that all the five chosen cards can be held\nup for all to see, quietly take out the 20 even cards from your vest pocket and drop into it\nthe 20 odd cards.

From\nthe first draw out the top and bottom cards, A and K, putting them together; then the Q\nand 2, Jack, 3, 10, and 4 and so on. Each packet will give six pairs totaling fourteen, and\nthe 4 sevens making two more pairs you will have twenty -six pairs with the Joker being\nthe odd card. Place the pack so arranged face down on a table. The back of the top card\nmust be polished and its face roughened: the second card must have its back roughened\nand its face polished; the third, back polished, face roughened, and so on throughout the\n292 deck. Finally roughen both sides of the Joker. For the process of polishing see page 95,\nfor roughening page 104.\nA deck so arranged and prepared may be handed out to be shuffled overhand without fear\nsince the pairs cling together. If a spectator prepares to dovetail shuffle, stop him under\npretense of not wishing to have the cards bent. Now if the Joker goes in between two\nrough surfaces it will push the cards above and below it out a little on the opposite side,\nin this case the card above it and the card below will always total 14; but if it goes in\nbetween two smooth cards, the two cards above or below will total 14.\nWhether all this trouble m erely to force one number is worth while is for the reader to\ndecide for himself.\nTELEPATHY?\nEFFECT: —The performer fans a borrowed deck of cards with the faces towards himself.\nHe borrows a pencil and puts any mark or initial a spectator may call on one of the cards.\nHe shuffles the pack and asks the spectator to call the name of any card that comes into\nhis mind. He fans the pack, locates the card named and hands it out. It bears the mark or\ninitial that was called. No other card in the pack bears any ma rk.\n\nWORKING: —This depends on the use of a \"thumb writer\". The borrowing of the pencil,\nthe pretended writing and the return of the pencil, merely built up the effect\npsychologically. Nothing is written at that time. The card is marked at the moment when\nit is found in the fan and withdrawn from the other cards.\nThumb writers of various kinds from the thumb tip to the tiny flesh colored metal bands\nfitting over the ball of the thumb, can be had from the magic dealers. Ingenious\nperformers will find many uses for this gimmick."

Soak this for some time in water and carefully peel off the back, then dry it with\nblotting paper placed between the leaves of a book to keep it flat. Cut a piece of carbon\npaper slightly smaller than the card and gum this to the prepared back, the tracing side\noutwards. Next take a court card from any spare deck and with a razor blade cut on the\nline that encloses the picture along the top and bottom and one side, so that the center of\nthe card will open like a book, the uncut lef t side acting as a hinge.\nPaste the prepared back on top of this card, leaving the central flap quite free. Fit a small\npiece of thin white paper between the flap and the carbon sheet, adding a dot of gum at\neach corner. This paper can be used for two car ds but must be renewed for each\nperformance. This card is on the top of the pack which is used as a rest when the name of\nthe card thought of is written. When you take the pack and run through the faces it is\nnecessary only to lift the flap and read the im pression. The prepared card can then be\npalmed and disposed of. Methods for using the card are left to the reader."

The slit is about 2 1/2 inches long and\n\nabout 1/2 an inch wide, so that a card can be pushed through it if turned endwise. It is cut\nslightly nearer to one end than the other. If the pack is set with all the slits coinciding and\none card is reversed the end of that card must protrude slightly when the pack hangs on a\nribbon passed through all the slits. That is the secret.\nWhen any card has been freely chosen, simply turn the deck round before the card is\nreplaced. Thread a ribbon through the slits, throw a handkerchief over the pack and then\ngive the two ends of the r ibbon to be held. The end of the chosen card will protrude\nabove the others. Reach beneath the covering and find the protruding card, separate the\npack at that point and push the card right through the holes in the cards on one side of it\nor the other. Pus h the pack together and bring the card out upright like the others.\nRemove it from the ribbon and show that it is the chosen card.

You feel it with your hands behind your\nback to get the vibration. With a piece of chalk you draw a correct picture of the card on a\nslate or blackboard.\nThe cards are prepared beforehand by tracing the indices with Carter's red ink for the red\ncards and any good black ink for the black suits. You moisten the tip of right forefinger\nand when pretending to feel the card simply press the finger tip on the index and so get an\nimprint of it. This can be read under cover of handling the chalk if you fi nish the trick\nusing a slate or a blackboard.\nEditors Note: Dr. Bates of Freemont, Ohio was the first to show this trick.

    "text": "This trick can be done with any deck. Have the cards shuffled by a spectator, take them\nand under pretense of finding out if the deck is complete, count the cards face down on\nthe table. As you deal the 2nd, 3rd and 4th cards press the nail of your 2nd finger on the\nface of each card near the top right hand corner. A slight lump will thus be made on the\nbacks of these three cards in just the position to be felt with the ball of the left thumb in\ndealing the cards. After the count the three marked cards will be 2nd, 3rd and 4th from\nthe bottom.\nAllow a card t o be freely selected and noted. Put the pack on the table, the chosen card is\nplaced on top and the pack cut by the spectator, burying it. Tell him to deal the cards one\nby one into 2, 3, or 4 heaps as he pleases. Infallibly this will bring his card above one of\nthe marked cards. Let him look through the packets and hand you the one containing his\ncard, face down. Pretending you have to know just how many cards are in the packet,\ndeal the cards face down. When you feel the lump you know that the card just d ealt is the\n300 chosen one. Count the number of cards you deal on top of it and you know its exact\nposition enabling you to reveal it in any way you please. Present the trick as being\ndependent on an intricate mathematical formula.\nThe Use of Short Cards in Magical Effects\nProbably the earliest device in the way of preparing cards for secret use in performing\ntricks was the wide or long card. As the name implies one card is a trifle wider or longer\nthan its fellows and therefore projects slightly either at the end or the sid e. To prepare\nsuch a pack have all the cards but one slightly shortened or narrowed by means of a\nprinter's guillotine. Later came the thick card, two cards glued together and dried under\npressure, which can be easily found by the fingers in riming the edg es. Variations of this\nidea such as cutting the picture of a court card from its frame and gluing it to the face of a\nduplicate court card, cutting out the spots and gluing them over the spots of a duplicate\ncard, etc., but all of these devices are liable to detection when the deck is handled by a\nspectator. The most satisfactory method is that of cutting one card a trifle shorter than the\nrest. Such a card forms an invaluable key card, it can be found immediately by riming the\ndeck and is practically undet ectable to anyone who does not already know of it.\nAs with strippers, to handle the short card intelligently requires some practice and the\ncard should be lightly cut that the difference in length would only be revealed by minute\ninspection. The use of a card cut so short that the deck divides at it, when riffl ed, with a\nloud click, simply ruins an artifice that is invaluable when intelligently used. To any one\nhaving a working knowledge of the few indispensable sleights the short card is a very\nvaluable a ccessory. The danger is that it renders some operations so easy that the\nbeginner especially comes to depend on it entirely.\nThe drawback to the short card is that it has to be prepared and therefore can only be used\nwith your own deck. On occasion this c an be overcome by carrying a small pair of\nscissors and working an effect that entails your leaving the room. By carrying off one of\nthe cards in use you can cut off a shaving and secretly return the card to the deck. There\nis, however, a plan for getting the same effect easily and quickly with any deck at a\nmoment's notice. This was, I believe, devised by Louis Nikola, the English magician, at\nany rate he was the first to record it in print in his book \"The Nikola Card System\" which\nwas published in 1927. The plan he recommends there is to bend up the bottom left hand\ncorner of a card and work it between the thumb and finger until it is soft. Only a small\n302 corner is necessary, say to within an eighth of an inch or so of the edge. When the cards\nare riffl ed w ith the thumb across this corner, the cards will break at that point, so that\nsuch a card may be put practically to all the uses of a short card.\nThe following tricks with a short card have been selected from \"Tricks with a Short\nCard\", by U. F. Grant, th e well known magician and magic dealer. They will serve to\nillustrate the uses to which the principle can be put. It would be impossible to give more\nsince there is hardly a card trick in which a short card could not be employed. I reiterate\nthat the short card should not be used constantly but only on occasion, when it becomes\nan invaluable weapon for throwing the spectators off the track."

    "text": "This brilliant trick was the invention of the late Dr. Hofzinser of Vienna, who was\nregarded as the greatest card conjurer in the world. In his hands this experiment must\nhave been a veritable masterpiece of artistic card conjuring, and the modem magician w ill\nfind this latest adaptation1 a decided addition to his repertoire.\nThis is one of the most effective card tricks ever devised. The reason that it is so seldom\nseen is probably b ecause the explanations given in the textbooks are unnecessarily\ncomplicated and give the trick the appearance of being difficult. The moves in the routine\nthat follows have been arranged to simplify the procedure as much as possible.\nThe only requirement s are —a small stand or card easel or, failing that, three glasses,\nagainst which to stand cards for display, an ordinary deck of cards with two extra\nduplicate cards, two Tens of Spades for example. Any card can be used but the black\nsuits are preferable i f the feat is to be performed before a large audience since the spots\nstand out so much more plainly under artificial light. Let us suppose that Tens of Spades\nare used, place all three on top of the deck. Begin by Shuffling the deck overhand in this\nmanne r—undercut about three -quarters of the deck, injog the first card and shuffle off.\nAsk a spectator to draw a card, insert the tip of the left little finger below the jogged card\nand, spreading the pack, force one of the three Tens. This is much easier and more natural\nthan making the pass to bring the Tens to the middle. The shuffle, being quite genuine as\nfar as the cards actually shuffled are concerned, tends to throw the spectator off guard and\nrenders the force easier. 1 Reprinted from \"Card Manipulations\" by Jean Hugard (p. 112 - 115). The five sections of this book are\nnow published by Max Holden, N. Y. C. as one volume, and comprise the very latest tricks and all the\nsleights known to modern card conjuring. Four versions of \"Everywhere and Nowhere\" are given. Other\npresentations of this trick will he found in T. Nelson Downs' \"The Art of Magic\"; and in \"Mo dem Card\nEffects and How to Perform Them.\" Hofzinser's original version will be found in his book \"Card\nConjuring\" by Ottokar Fischer and edited by S. H. Sharpe.\n308 In any case there should be no di fficulty in forcing one of the three Tens.\nAs the spectator notes his card, close up the deck and insert the tip of the left little finger\nabove the two remaining Tens. Hold the deck in right hand, fingers at the outer end, the\nthumb at the inner end, hol ding the break. As you ask the spectator to replace his card\nallow a few cards to drop from the bottom of deck on to your left palm, then a few more,\nfinally let drop all the cards below the break and hold the left hand out to receive the\nchosen card which is thus returned on top of the other two Tens. Make the pass, bringing\nthe Tens to the top.\nIt is necessary now to place the Tens so that one shall be next to the bottom card, one on\ntop of the deck and the third one third from the top. To do this the si mplest way, grasp the\npack with the right hand as for an overhand shuffle, press firmly on the top and bottom\ncard with the fingers and thumb on the left hand and lift all the cards but these two with\nthe right hand. The top card, the first Ten, will fall on the bottom card and you drop the\ncards from the right hand on top of them, thus placing the first Ten next to the bottom. Do\nthis casually, while talking, then as if having changed your mind as to the manner of\nshuffling, split the deck in half and riff le shuffle. Let the two lowest cards in the left hand\npacket fall first, then execute a genuine riffle until the packets are reached. Hold back the\ntop card of the left hand packet and let it fall between the two top cards of the right hand\npacket, i. e. b etween the other two Tens. The three cards are now in the position\nrequired —one on the top, one third from the top and the last next to the bottom card.\nThe usual patter runs to the effect that by means of a scientific system a card can be\nfound in a shuffled deck in not more than three trials. \"The most likely position,\" you say,\n\"Is the top of the pack.\" Make a double lift and show the second card.\n\"Is this....................of..................your card?\"\n\"No.\"\n\"Then I'll put it here on the table out of the way.\" Turn the two cards down, as one, take\noff the top card, the first Ten of Spades, and put it face down on the table or easel, on\nstand it up right against one of the glasses.\n\"The next likely position is on the bottom. Here is your card, the.............of.....................\n..\" Say this confidently as if sure of its being right and hold the pack upright in the left\nhand, the bottom card fac ing the audience.\n\"What? Wrong again? Then I must put this card with the other one.\" Drop the left hand\nand by means of the Glide draw out the second Ten of Spades and put it beside the first.\nNow shuffle overhand by first running one card, then drop abou t half the deck on it, injog\none card and shuffle off. The last Ten being the next card below the jogged card, make a\nbreak at that point with the right thumb at the inner end of the deck, separate the next two\ncards, Ten of Spades and an indifferent card, from the rest and push them forward, as one\ncard, till they protrude from the outer end of the deck for about an inch. Turn the pack\n309 upright and with the right hand, thumb at rear and fingers in front, pull the two cards up\nfor about three -quarters of the ir length above the deck. Assert now with the utmost\nconfidence that you have succeeded.\n\"I have only this one more chance and as my system has never failed yet this ..................\nof .................. simply must be your card. No again? You are sure ? Pardon me, but did any\none else see the chosen card? Oh, excuse me. I don't doubt you for a moment, but it is\nsuch an extraordinary thing for the trick to fail I thought you might have made a mistake.\nThis is not your card.\" The more bewildered and anxio us you can appear to be, the better\nthe final effect. Drop the left hand, push the lower of the two cards flush with the pack,\ndraw out the upper card, a Ten of Spades, and put it with the other two on the table.\n\"I must finish the trick somehow. You all say that not one of these cards (point to the\neasel or the glasses) is your card? Very well. May I ask you what was the card you\nchose? The Ten of Spades? Do you think it would be possible for me to make you see\nany one of these cards as the Ten of Spades? No? Let us try. Which one shall I take? The\nmiddle card?\"\nTake that card and hold it with its back to the audience.\n\"Of course it isn't really a Ten of Spades, but it will appear so to you.\"\nWave your hands in pretended hypnotic passes, then turn the c ard face out.\n\"You all see it as the Ten of Spades? Very well, I wil l replace it here.\"\nMake the bottom change in the swing towards the table and put the indifferent card down\nface inwards.\n\"You are still skeptical ? Let me prove that you arc an under hy pnotic influence. Of these\ntwo which would you like to see as the Ten of Spades? This one? Very well.\"\nRepeat the same business and again change the card for an indifferent one by the bottom\nchange, placing this card down with the first.\n\"One card only i s left. You will see this also as a Ten of Spades.\"\nShow the card as before, but this time it must be changed by the top change. Show the\ncard upright, holding it with fingers on top end, thumb on the lower. The left hand holds\nthe deck close to the body about waist high, as you say:\n\"Of course the card is not a Ten of Spades. The real Ten is here in the deck.\"\nDrop the right hand bringing the card on top of the deck and at the same moment push the\ntop card of the lower deck over to the right. Release th e Ten of Spades from the right\nhand and grip this top card in exactly the same way. A moment later the left thumb pulls\n310 the Ten squarely on to the pack and moves away, the right remaining stationary. Finally\nplace the indifferent card with the other two.\n\"Let me give you further proof. You see this top card?\"\nMake the double lift and show an indifferent card. Name it and turn the two cards, as one,\nface down. Take off the top card, a Ten of Spades, and after more hypnotic passes turn its\nface to the spect ators.\n\"Now you see it as the Ten of Spades.\" Replace it on top. Wave your hands again.\n\"Now look at the bottom card. It also is the Ten of Spades.\" Hold the pack upright and\nshow the Ten on the Bottom. Under cover of this surprise make the pass and hold a break\nwith the right thumb between the two packets. Show the pack upright in the right hand,\nbottom card facing the audience, an indifferent card is now seen to be there.\n\"It is all an optical illusion. The cards are not really Tens of Spades They only appear so.\"\nPlace the pack in the left hand and slip the tip of the left little finger into the break. Lift\noff the top card and show it is an indifferent card now.\n\"But when I put you under the influence you can see the Ten of Spades only, look.\"\nCut the pack at the break and hold the top portion upright, a Ten of Spades again faces\nthe audience. Insert the tip of the left little finger under the top card of the lower packet, i.\ne. the third Ten. Replace the top packet and make the pass, bringing the t hree Tens to the\nbottom, riffle off the inner ends of these three cards and insert the tip of the left little\nfinger between them and the rest of the cards, and hold the deck in position to execute the\nbottom palm. (Erdnase, p. 86.)\n\"I know exactly what y ou all suspect, that I have been trying to mislead you and that all\nthe cards are Tens of Spades. I wouldn't do anything as barefaced as that for worlds.\nLook! This card is not a Ten.\"\nPalm the three Tens in the left hand and at once turn the first card on the table face out.\n\"Nor this,\" turn the next.\" and this last one is not a Ten either. Turn it also.\n\"You see there is not a single Ten of Spades in the deck.\"\nSpread the cards face up on the table with a flourish turning your right side to the\naudience as you do so and slipping the three palmed cards into your left trousers at the\nsame moment.\n\"In fact knowing that card is an unlucky one for my trick, I put it in my pocket before I\nbegan. Here it is.\"\nThrust your left hand into your pocket, bring out one of the three Tens and throw it on the\ntable.\nSmoothly executed and well acted the feat has an extraordinary effect. It is one of the few\ncard tricks suitable for performance befo re the largest or the smallest audiences. Paul\nRosini, the Philadelphia prestidigitator , makes a feature of the trick and in his hands it is a\nmasterpiece.\nA very good plan for displaying the three cards when performing the trick in the parlor, is\nto take a large thick book, stand it upright and insert the cards as shown in the illustration.\nThis is another idea of Dr. Jack Daley's who also makes a specialty of the trick. In his\nhands it leaves nothing to be desired.\nTHE ORIGINAL \"STOP\" TRICK\nIt would se em almost as if the old time magicians had used all the plots possible for the\npresentation of card tricks and that all that is left for the successors is to improve the\nmethod by which the old effects were done. This fact is one of the reasons why the pub lic\ngenerally complains that magic is always the same. While to a magician a modem\nmethod of doing an old trick will convert it into a new trick, to the layman it remains\nsimply the same old effect. Not knowing, nor caring to know, the vastly improved\nmeth ods used to bring the effect about, he simply asks, \"Why do magicians always do the\nsame things?\" The best audiences to a skilled magician are those composed of people\nwho know something of the technical part of magic and can therefore appreciate his skill .\nThere would seem to be a good argument here in favor of a widespread promulgation of\nour so -called secrets, exposures if you will, but that is apart from our subject.\nThe first of the \"Stop\" tricks was used and described by Robert Houdin almost a centur y\nago. Briefly the effect was this —three cards were selected from a pack, replaced and the\npack shuffled. Standing beside a table the magician removed cards from the top one by\none and laid them down, at the same time inviting the first of the spectators w ho had\n312 taken a card to call \"Now\" whenever he chose, and stating that no matter when the call\nwas made the card then in his hand would be the spectator's. Such proved to be the case\nand the same effect was repeated with the remaining cards.\nThe Effect as worked by Ralph W. Read\nPROPS AND PREPARATION: - A regular pack and a three -bank forcing pack to match;\nalso the well known \"Card Servante\".\nThe forcing pack consists of \"short\" cards, say sixteen each of 9 -D, J-S, and 2 -H, with a\n\"long\" card between each bank and one \"long\" card on the bottom. These three \"long\"\ncards are all alike, say Q -H. Now add two indifferent \"long\" cards to the pack, say a 7 -S\non bottom and a 4 -D on the top. This pack now has 53 cards which go in clip of the card\nservante on back o f table or chair.\nIn the regular pack locate the 9 -D, J-S and 2 -H placing them on top of pack, and all is\nready.\nPERFORMANCE: - False shuffle regular pack and force the 9 -D, J-S and 2 -H in order.\nLet spectators shuffle their cards back in, then you take p ack, return to the platform and\nstate what has been done, stressing the fact that each spectator shuffled. While talking\nyou cut the pack a few times, but don't expose any cards.\nYou now reach for the table (bearing servante) with hand holding the regular pack ready\nfor the switch, bring the table forward, and with forcing pack now in your hand, casually\nexpose the bottom card (7 -S) . . . \"I shall now remove the cards\" (you glance at 7 -S) ... \"I\nhope no one took this bottom one\" (remove 7 -S and lay face do wn on the table) . . . \"I\nshall take them one at a time\" (remove top card - 4-D - and give the the audience a flash\nof it) ... and place this on the table (lay down 4 -D) . . . \"Will the party who selected the\nfirst card please say \"Now\" when he feels the i mpulse?\" You are slowly removing cards\n(9-D) one by one, placing them on the table as you speak and of course you hold his card\nwhen he calls \"Now.\"\nIf they delay saying \"Now,\" you remove cards at snail's pace —you can be as slow as\nthey, and need never ru n beyond the sixteen bank. You can byplay as to \"this one, or the\nnext?\" - \"Do you want to change your mind?\", etc. before you expose the card, and\nalways have them name it before you turn it over.\nYou make the pass at the first \"long\" card before startin g on the second selection, and\nlikewise for the last card. If the bottom card is accidentally exposed, the same Q -H gives\nmute evidence that there has been no manipulation.\nA later addition to Robert Houdin's trick provided for the spectator striking a be ll of the\npush button variety instead of calling \"Now.\" For stage purposes the trick as described is\nstill one of the most effective possible with cards but it is not suitable for close work or\nsmall audiences. The method that follows is specially adapted for such cases.\n313 \"SAY WHEN\""

    "text": "The modern magician specially prides himself on being able to produce with a borrowed\ndeck effects which originally called for the use of specially prepared cards or forcing\ndecks. This is a brilliant example of the solution of one of these problems. The \"Stop\"\neffect is here produced with a borrowed deck. Two hats and a len gth of wide ribbon are\nthe only accessories required. Place the hats, crown downwards, on the seats of two\nchairs about four feet apart and stretch the ribbon between them, one end in each hat. A\nsmall weight should be attached to each end of the ribbon to hold it in position.\n314 In placing the hats and adjusting the ribbon you have taken the opportunity to introduce\ninto the right hand hat some ten or twelve cards, previously palmed from the pack. Next\nhave two or three cards freely selected, noted, replaced and brought to the top in\nwhatever way you prefer. Thoroughly shuffle the cards and drop them into the left hand\nhat.\nTake a card from the bottom of the pack, slide it along the ribbon explaining what you\nintend to do, just before dropping it into the se cond hat, turn it around and show that it is\nan indifferent card. Next take the top card, slide it along the ribbon, back outwards of\ncourse, put it quietly into the second hat and instantly back palm it. Dip your hand into\nhat No. 1 and bring out the same card at your finger tips. Pass this along the ribbon fairly\nslowly and repeat the movements until the spectator calls \"Stop.\" The card is named and\nturned and shown to be the one. Repeat the same process with the second and third cards,\nfinally the spare cards are taken out of the second hat and returned to the pack as being\nthose actually passed.\nIf soft hats are used, have a small tie clip sewn to the ends of the ribbons in lieu of the\nweights which have a tendency to drag the hats over sideways. These should be sewn so\nthat the ribbon will be vertical and not flat between the hats. The use of a bell or a small\nwhistle instead of the spectator calling \"Stop,\" makes the trick even more effective. This\nbrilliant method is particularly interesting as being one of the few in which the back palm\nis put to its legitimate use as a secret sleight and as an example of what might have been\ndone with it had its use not been practically limited to juggling flourishes.\nTHINK \"STOP\""

    "text": "Performer has any card freely selected and returned to the pack. Pack is shuffled and\nhanded to the spectator who is instructed to deal the cards one at a time onto performer's\nhand and any time he feels like it to stop and the selected card is found there.\nThis effect is about 97% perfect and when it works is a real miracle in card magic. Paul\nNoffke, a very clever card man, works this effect and in his hands it is 100% perfect. Max\nHolden worked it for Tommy Downs and Eddie McLaughlin and had them completely\nstumped. As t he title implies it is a psychological trick and depends on the manner in\nwhich the performer instructs the spectator to deal the cards on to his hand.\nWORKING: —Any card is selected and while the spectator is looking at his card,\nperformer thumb counts ni ne cards from the bottom of the pack. These nine cards are\nremoved and taken in the right hand in the action of cutting the pack and the selected card\nbeing replaced on the top of the pack the cards in the right hand are placed on top and a\nfalse shuffle i s made keeping the top ten cards intact.\nThe pack is handed to a spectator and he is instructed to deal the cards one at a time face\ndown onto performer's hand. When the spectator has reached the third card performer\nsays FASTER. At the fifth card perform er says STOP ANYWHERE and times himself in\nthe manner in which he says this. As a rule it will be found that the spectator will stop on\nthe ninth or tenth card. All that remains is to work it up and show the tenth card as the\nselected card that the spectat or found himself. If the spectator stops at the ninth card,\nperformer says, \"Now turn over the next card.\" He does so and it is his card. If he stops\nwhen the tenth card is on the performer's hand, he just turns it over. In case the spectator\ngoes beyond t hat card, performer notes the position of the tenth card on his hand and side\nsteals it out bringing it to the top and then revealing it.\nThe thumb count is very useful in many card effects. Pack is held in the left hand, thumb\non one side and fingers on the other. Right hand is on top of the pack, fingers at one end,\nfirst finger bent on top and the thumb at the left c orner nearest himself. This corner is\nriffled with the thumb and it is an easy matter to count nine cards as they are riffled. A\nbreak is now held here with the left little finger which holds the break until the cut is\nmade."

    "text": "Mr. Walsh calls a friend on the telephone and offers to do a trick with cards. The p erson\ncalled is to shuffle a pack of cards and then look at the bottom of the pack and note what\ncard is on the bottom and remember it. He is then to count from the top of the pack, on\nthe table, the same number of cards. Say there was a Five of Clubs on t he bottom of the\npack; the person would count five cards from the top of the pack onto the table and then\nplace the balance of the pack in hand, on top of the cards on the table. He is then asked to\nturn the pack face up and call the cards from the bottom one at a time, slowly. After a\nnumber of cards have been called Mr. Walsh names the card that was on the bottom of\nthe pack at the start and remembered by person on other end of the telephone. The means\nused are very simple, yet the person doing the naming of the cards is thrown right off the\ntrack. You have a pad from one to thirteen written on it. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12\nAfter the person has noted the bottom card and counted the same number of cards to\ncorrespond with it and then placed the pack on top of the counted cards he is to turn the\npack face up and call the cards slowly one at a time.\nAs he calls the first card, performer does not count this, but as he calls the second card\nsay, Jack of Hearts, for instance. Performer notes this on pad unde r number 1, third card\nunder number two, etc. For example,\n\nAll performer does is look over list and see what card corresponds with the number over\nit. In this ease the Five Clubs is under five so that should be his selected card, but very\noften there will be another card under a corresponding number, say, a Nine o f Diamonds\nappeared under the number nine. Then it could be one of the two, so you boldly say, \"It\nwas a diamond.\" If he says \"No\", you know it was the five of Clubs. If he says \"Yes\", go\nright on and finish the trick.\nIt is necessary that you perform or go thru this routine before going to the next method as\nthe second method will not be confusing after this one is learned.\nThe part that throws the person off the track is - He is calling names of the cards and does\nnot know that you are counting and his attention being on the names of the cards, he does\nnot count.\n317 AL BAKER METHOD\nIn my method I have a person shuffle the cards and then divide them into two portions.\nHe selects one heap and lays the other heap aside.\nAgain after shuffling the heap he has , he is asked to note the card on the bottom of the\npack, remember it, and then count onto the table the same number of cards as the value of\nthe card on the bottom of the pack. If, say, the Seven of Spades was on the bottom of the\npack, he must count from the top of the pack onto the table seven cards. He is then asked\nto place the balance of cards in hand, on top of the cards on table and square the pack.\nIf he were now to cut the cards it would be impossible to find the selected card and yet,\nthis is wh at you lead him to believe actually takes place.\nYou ask him to pick up the cards and call the cards from the top of the pack, slowly. As\nhe calls the first one, say for instance, the Ace of Clubs, you say, \"Just wait a minute, put\nthat card back on top, I forgot something.\" He places the Ace back on top and you\ncontinue, \"I wanted you to cut the cards and complete the cut. Will you please do so?\" He\ncuts the cards, BUT, the Ace of Clubs is now your key card. Just remember \"Ace of\nClubs\".\nHave a pencil an d pad handy and now ask him to call the cards by name from the top of\nthe pack. Suppose he called the following cards — you would jot them down in this\nfashion:\n\nWhen your hear Ace of Clubs you jot this down but let him go on naming cards, but you\nneed no t note any after the Ace is called as this is our key.\nTo find the selected card you start at the Ace of Clubs and count to your left or back in\nthis manner. You don't count the Ace nor the next card but at the next or third card you\nstart, 12345678, and as you come to seven, if there is a seven card marked down that is\nhis card.\nIf you count back as you count nine, if there is a nine corresponding with your count, his\ncard was a nine.\nSometimes there will be say a five at the five count and a ten at the ten count. Boldly say,\n\"Was it a ten?\" If he replies in the affirmative, name the ten. If he says \"No\", name the\nfive.\nOf course, it is understood, should there be a picture card on the bottom of the pack, at\nthe beginning of his count, say a Jack, he sh ould count eleven cards onto the table - A\nQueen 12 and a King 18.\n318 THE CASE OF THE FOUR KINGS\nJohn J. Crimmins, Jr.\nAny deck may be used and there is no preparation required for this effective impromptu\nexperiment.\nRemove the four Aces and the four King s from the pack and show plainly by running\nover the cards with their faces to the spectators that there are no duplicates of either. Pick\nup the Kings with the right hand, spread them fanwise and place them on top of the pack\nheld in your left hand. As yo u close the fan slip the tip of your left finger between the\nthird and fourth Kings.\nTake the Aces, squared together, by the top and bottom outer corners between the right\nthumb and forefinger and show the face of the outer Ace. Turn a little to the left in the\naction of placing the Aces on the top of the pack. At the moment that the right hand\ncovers the pack, straighten out your left fingers and carry the three Kings upward making\nan opening between them and the rest of the pack, bookwise. Drop the four Aces into this\nopening and at once close the left fingers bringing the three Kings on top of the Aces.\nThe pack must be held with its back to the front and almost vertical, the action of raising\nthe Kings being completely covered by the back of the right h and.\nDeal the four Aces, as you say, really three Kings and One Ace, turning the Ace face up\non the other three cards. Deal four Kings really three Aces and one King, turning the\nKing face up. Smoothly carried through there can be no doubt about the piles being really\nthe Kings and the Aces as they appear to be. With your patter running on the lines of\n\"birds of a feather knocking together\" or any other plausible plot, transpose the visible\nAce and King, and then for your climax turn the two piles face upw ards, the other three\nAces and Kings have apparently followed the leaders."

    "page_start": 317,

    "text": "(Reprinted from GENII Vol. I. No. I. Sept. 1936.)\nWe are pleased to be able to offer through the courtesy of Jack McMillen, the inventor, a\nnew method of wor king the rising card experiment that is certain to take its place among\nthe thousand and one ways of working it already in existence. For impromptu work this\nhas many distinctive features. Nothing is required save the cards, which may be\nborrowed. The card rises actually from the center of the deck, yet it is held squared up,\nneither thumb nor fingers being inserted in the deck to push the card up. And the\nprinciple employed to attain this effect is absolutely new.\nAt the request of the performer anyone sh uffles the deck and then deals off three cards.\nThe magician picks up these three and requests a spectator to look at one of them. Nine\ntimes out of ten it will be the center card that is selected, but if not, the performer simply\n319 asks that a card be taken , and then has it replaced between the other two, so that it\nbecomes the central one of the three.\n\nThe three cards are laid momentarily face down on the table, while the deck is placed in\nthe left hand, fingers on one side and thumb along the other. The top card of the three on\nthe table is picked up and shoved into the center of the deck, but only half way, being left\nprojecting half its length from the end of the deck. The left thumb holds a break beneath\nit. The right hand takes up the next card from the table - the noted card - and shoves it half\nway into the deck from the end, apparently directly below the card already pushed in.\nActually the left thumb releases the card below the first of the three, so that there is a card\nbetween the two extending half way from the deck. The last of three cards is picked up\nand pushed in below the others, but again th e left thumb releases one of the cards of the\ndeck so that the third card is inserted below. Thus we have the deck with three cards\nextending half their length from its end; unknown to the audience they are separated from\neach other by indifferent cards.\nThe deck with the cards still projecting is turned over in the left hand so that the faces of\nthe cards are to the audience. The deck is held with the first finger projecting out beyond\nthe end, other fingers at one side and thumb at the other. The right h and is brought up so\nthat is conceals the inner end of the pack. Now the left first finger pushes the three\nprojecting cards into the deck, flush with the rest. This action causes the indifferent cards\nbetween the three to be pushed out the other end by fr iction. These two projecting cards\nare concealed by the right hand. Now the right hand held in such a manner that it keeps\nthe projecting cards hidden, bevels the end of the deck, spreading the cards downwards\nslightly at the end from back to front. The pe rformer calls attention to what he is doing\nand explains that he is about to make the chosen card rise and is spreading the cards so\nthat the spectators will be able to see that the card actually rises from the place where it\nwas inserted. This feature doe s, incidentally, serve to make the feat more effective, but\nthe real reason for spreading the cards downwards from the end is so that the face cards\nof the pack are brought down enough to conceal the projecting cards behind them when\nthe right hand is take n away.\nThe deck is held in the left hand with the fingers on one side and the thumb at the other,\nnear the lower end, the cards being held upright. When working for just one or two\nspectators, there is no need to worry about angle. When working for more, the deck is\n320 held with the left side slightly towards the spectators. From this angle, the left fingers\nholding the deck completely screen the cards projecting from the center, downwards,\nbehind the front cards.\nThe left little finger is placed under thes e two projecting cards and they are pushed up\nflush with the rest of the center cards. This causes the card between them, the selected\ncard, to rise from the upper end of the deck. Due to the way the cards are spread it can be\nseen that the card is rising from the center of the deck. During the rising, the upper end of\nthe deck is tipped slightly towards the spectators, to conceal the movement of the little\nfinger. As soon as the projecting cards have been pushed up flush with the rest, the little\nfinger re sumes its place at the side of the deck as the performer offers it to the spectator\nthat he himself remove his card from the position in which it has risen. All the cards are\nnow in the position to which they were openly adjusted and examination of the cho sen\ncard, and the remainder of the deck as well will give no clue to the method employed.\nMIRASKILL\nby Stewart James\n(Reprinted by permission from \"The Jinx\")\nI don't know where Mr. James got his title for this mystery, but anytime anyone can\nproduce suc h a problem I'll be the last to argue over what it is to be called. Certainly no\nconcocted effect has in years been so original in effect upon the watchers.\nI have used the problem any number of times since learning it, and I have yet to find\npeople who a ren't amazed at the outcome. I won't go into any reason why it works\nbecause of limits in space, but it does work, and that's about the most important.\nThe performer has a deck of cards and two pieces of paper with a pencil. The deck may\nbe a borrowed one which has been in constant use. A spectator mixes the cards, and the\nperformer asks if he prefers black or red. Without touching the deck or seeing any of the\ncards, performer now writes a prophecy on one of the papers and puts it with the writing\nside do wn on the table. The spectator is now asked to remove the cards from the shuffled\ndeck two at a time and turn them face up. If two reds are together he is to keep them in a\npile before him (we are pretending he wanted red - if black he'd keep black pairs). If two\nblacks are together he is to put them in a pile before the performer, and if the two are of\nopposite color, they are to go into a third or discard pile.\nThe spectator does as directed, taking the cards off in pairs, and putting them in their\ncorre ct pile. As soon as all of the cards are separated in pairs, the performer asks the\nspectator to count the number of cards in his pile and then the number of cards in the\nperformer's pile. Then the spectator is asked to look at and read aloud the written\nprophecy which has not been touched. It reads, \"Your pile will have four more cards than\nmine.\" AND IT'S RIGHT, despite the fact that the performer did not touch the cards after\nthe genuine shuffle by spectator.\n321 Immediately the performer tells another spec tator to gather together the cards and shuffle\nthem thoroughly. He writes a prophecy on the second pieces of paper AND THEN ASKS\nspectator which color he wants for himself, telling him to place pairs of that color in front\nof himself, pairs of the other co lor in front of the performer, and pairs of mixed colors to\nthe side. Again, the cards are separated and again the two piles are counted. The\nprophecy, this time, reads, \"We will both have the same number of cards this time.\" And\neverything may be examined as there is no trickery to find.\nThis trick practically works itself. It is based on the actuality that, if a full deck of\ncards be so separated after a genuine mixing, the red and black piles will always contain\nan equal number of cards.\nThere is no way of telling EXACTLY HOW MANY will be in each pile, but they\npositively will be the same. Before starting, or during another effect, steal four cards of\none color from the deck. We shall say red. By stealing four cards of a color you\nunbalance the deck so that the red pile will be four cards less than the black when\nfinished. If you steal four black cards, the black pile will be four less than the red. You\ncan also steal two or six cards of a color and the pile of that color will be two or six less,\nbut four is about right. Don't ask me why it works. It does. Put these four stolen cards\nfacing the body in right trouser pocket.\nNow have the deck shuffled. Ask first spectator which color he prefers. Then write the\nprophecy to fit. If he wants the 'short' c olor, write that his pile will have four less than\nyours. Now explain how he is to separate the cards and let him go ahead. The outcome\nwill be as you prophesied. About half way through the cards you drop your hand to\npocket and palm the four stolen cards. All eyes and attention being on the two piles, you\ncarelessly pick up those in the discard, square them, and put back, you have added the\nstolen cards which sets you for the second time. No one ever pays any attention to the\ndiscard.\nThe first prophecy h aving been found correct, the performer, without touching the cards,\nasks that they be picked up and mixed again. This time you write the prophecy BEFORE\nasking the spectator which color he wants. As the deck is now complete, the piles will be\nthe same and it doesn't matter. Now try out this masterpiece and you'll find it to be one of\nhe best card mysteries in years."

    "text": "Numerous excellent versions exist of the effect in which a chosen card reverses itself in\nthe pack; the particular feature of this version is that any card called for is instantly\ncaused to reverse itself in the pack! To give the effect more in detail: the performer first\nruns the deck from hand to hand, showing without calling particular attention to it that all\ncards are face down. The spectator is requested to call the name of any card he thinks of;\ninstantly the magician runs the cards from hand to hand again, and the card whose name\nwas called will be found face up in the face down pack. A further elaboration can be\nworked by fanning out the cards and requesting the spectator to insert the joker face up at\nany spot he fancies. The deck is then closed up ; when the cards are spread again the card\nrequired will be found up next to the joker, it having been caused to appear reversed at\nthat selected spot in the deck.\nLet us explain the basic version first, after which we will make clear the working of this\nvariation. The principle upon which the effect is worked was admittedly suggested by\nsome of the feats in Impey's Original Card Mysteries; the application is so far as I know\noriginal.\nThe deck is so arranged that every other card is face upward, all the red cards being face\nupward and the black face downward. The red cards are arranged in sequence, from top\nof deck downward, running Hearts Ace to King, and Diamonds Ace to King. Similarly if\nthe deck be turned completely over, the black cards will be face up, and they are also\narranged in order from top downward, Spades Ace to King, and Clubs Ace to King.\nThis gives us twenty -six sets of cards, each set consisting of two cards face to face. A\nspot of wax on the face of each card causes these pairs of cards to stick together, face to\nface, so that if the cards be run from hand to hand only the backs of cards will be visible,\nregardless of which side of deck is uppermost, yet a little pressure will cause the\nseparation of any desired pair of cards. With this much explained the method should be\nfairly obvious.\nThe performer first runs the cards from hand to hand, showing that all are face down. The\ncards must be run lightly, and not fanned. Now any card is named. The performer is\nholding the deck, say, so that all the black cards are face uppermost. If a black card be\nnamed he is all ready for the finale. If a red card is named the whole deck must be\nsecretly turned over. Suppose the ten of Spades to be named. The performer begins\nrunning the cards slowly from hand to hand, counting to himself. When he knows that he\nhas reached the ten of Spades, a slight pressure of the fingers separates that card from the\none above and consequently the ten of Spades appears face up in the face down deck.\nHard wax, such as bee wax, will work better than the usual soft wax employed by\nconjurers, as the cards separate more smoothly and with less pressure. Burling Hull's\n\"Magnetizo\" is ideal for this.\n326 Now for the variation. The spectator is handed the joker, which is ordinary. As before the\ncards are run from hand to hand to show that they are all face down, but the performer\nsecretly keeps track, and when he has run thirteen cards (or rather sets of cards) from the\nleft hand into the right, he stops, as he knows he holds half the deck in each hand. Now\nhe requests that any card be named. The two halves of the deck are then placed back\ntogether again, but in such position that when the deck is turned right side up the chosen\ncard will be in the top half of the deck. As the performer knows the positions of each suit,\nthis requires no calculation. The performer starts running the cards now from hand to\nhand again, counting. When he comes to the selected card, it is secretly separated from\nthe one above it, but kept out of sight beneath the spread fan of cards. At the same\nmoment the performer says: \"Place the joker anywhere you wish in the cards as I run\nthem,\" giving the impression that this is the reason for running out the cards, The\nperformer continues to pass the cards from hand to hand, running the selected face up\ncard secretly along beneath the spread fan, until the joker is placed in, when in closing up\nthe cards it requires no sleight -of-hand to slip the selected card into the fan next to the\njoker, where it will be found when the cards are once again spread out."

Turn it face\ndown and slide out the bottom card, placing it face up in front of the pile. In the same\nway show the ace at the bottom of the fourth pile, turn it down and slide out the ace,\n345 putting it face up in front of that pile.

    "text": "This may very well follow the last trick. Pick up the Aces and the rest of the cards\ncasually and without remark, but see that the Aces go on the top. Execute several riffle\nshuffles retaining the four top cards in that position. If you can follow this with a false\nshuffle and several false cuts do so. A nyway you should have the four Aces on the top\nwithout the audience having the slightest suspicion that they are there. Ask a spectator to\ncut the pack at about the middle and then each of the two packets in half again. Keep note\nof the packet with the Ace s. Pretend that one of the piles has a few cards too many, (not\nthe Ace packet), and ask the spectator to transfer a few cards from it to one of the other\nindifferent piles. Continue the same maneuver with the three indifferent piles. Then have\nhim transfe r one card from the Ace pile to one of the others. Next a couple of cards from\none of the two indifferent piles to the other, then two from the Ace pile onto one of these\ntwo heaps, finally (after carefully studying the size of the packets), transfer one o f the last\ntwo cards to the last indifferent heap. After all this apparently indiscriminate jockeying\naround of the cards the turning up of the Aces, one on each pile, is a baffling effect.\nThe moves, of course, may be made in any way you please, so long as you keep track of\nthe Aces.\nInstead of using four aces have four memorized cards on the top of the deck. Have the\npack cut into four piles by the spectator and then keeping track of the four cards have the\ntop cards shifted around as above, finishing w ith one of the memorized cards on each\npacket. Name them and have the cards turned over. Always use a borrowed deck to avoid\nsuspicion of using marked cards. This is G. G. Gravatt's variation."

    "text": "Two methods have been handed down through the ages of magic, in the first, the bottom\ncard is noted in taking the shuffled pack from a spectator. The pack is put behind the\nback, reversed and the bottom card placed face outwards on the top. Thus when the p ack\nis brought forward, the original bottom card still faces the spectators but all the rest face\nthe magician. The bottom card is named and the card facing the performer is noted.\nPutting the pack behind his back, this noted card is put in front of the or iginal bottom\ncard face out and is named, another card now faces the performer, this is noted and so the\ntrick continues.\nThe method is so well known that one can hardly find an audience in which someone is\nnot acquainted with the secret. This is precisel y what you want, to get someone to show\nthat he can do the trick, Secretly make the hall -pass, facing the deck, before you hand\nhim the cards. Your victim puts the cards behind his back, proceeds in the orthodox\nmethod, brings the pack forward and finds th at instead of a faced card he has the back of\na card facing him. He will probably try again but with no greater success. This is a good\nthing for use on occasion when suffering from the interruptions of the know -it-all.\nThe second and less well known meth od consists in first noting the bottom card and\nbringing it forward in the right hand, keeping the pack behind the back in the left hand,\nbut you have palmed the top card in your right hand and note it as you read the card\nbrought forward. Your right hand goes back for another card, straighten the card just\n350 palmed and palm another, which is noted in due course and so on. It is well to bring the\nright hand forward empty occasionally, putting it to your forehead as you affect great\nmental effort and incidenta lly let every one see the hand is empty.\nThe later methods follow."

Performer slowly goes through the pack and then requests that someone name a\nnumber between 1 and 52. Whatever number is given performer names the card at that\nnumber in the pack, and to prove he is correct the number is coun ted down to and there is\nthe same card that performer predicted. Again a number is given and again performer\nnames the card there and may again repeat.\nPerformer really memorizes every fifth card, making ten in all. To memorize the cards it\nis advisable to learn the mnemonic system which is explained in the \"Nikola Card\nSystem\", Chapter 20. Here is a brief summary for this effect:\n\nBy supplying vowels at discretion, numbers can be translated into the names.\n16 means L and V is Loaf. 20 is N and S - Nose. 25. N and V -Knife 30 -M and S. Moss.\n35- M and V -Muff. 40 -R and S -Rose. 45 -R and V - Roof. 50 F and S - Face.\nThe cards are represent ed in the same manner The Figure 1 made with one stroke 1 Ale 2 \" 2 strokes N Hen 3 \"3 \" M Emblem 4 represented by FOUR - R Arrow 5 FIVE - V Ivy 6 \" Similar shape - p or b Bee 7 \" \" \" 4 \" d Tea 8 \" (eight -aitch) sh or ch Shoe 9 \" (similar shape) k or g Key 0 \" (as in zero) s or z Lass\nClubs Hearts Spades Diamonds 2 Can (C & N) Hun Sun Din 3 Comb (C & M) Ham Sum Dome 4 Car Hair (H & R) Sire Dear 5 Cough Half Safe Dove 6 Cap Hop Soup Dope (Dand P) 7 Cat Hat Suit Dot\nAfter the table has been thoroughly familiarized as a groundwork it is easy to associate\nthem both together.\nYou have your ten key figures from Five to Fifty.\nGo through the pack slowly and note the card at the fifth position from the top. Say for\ninstan ce the card is the 2 of Clubs. The two of clubs is a Can, and Five is Ivy. Bring the\ntwo together and picture \"Ivy growing round a Can.\"\nAgain say the tenth card is a 5 of Spades. Ten is Lass, and 5 of Spades is a Safe. You get\n\"A Girl carrying a Safe.\"\nAlthough the above seems complicated it is really quite simple after just a little study.\nNow with your ten cards memorized. A number is requested. If it be one of your numbers\neverything is easy. But if the number is for instance 12 - just pass two cards from the\nbottom of the pack and name your 10th card. Likewise if 17 is given pass two cards and\nname your 15th card. If 19 is given pass one card from top and name the 20th card and so\non. The strong feature of this trick is that it is never necessary to p ass more than four\ncards at any time."

Carry on now with the cards in the vest pocket\nand stand with the right side turned a litt le towards the spectators to shield the action of\nyour left hand.\nSet No. 3 should lie face up behind a small stand or easel which you use to display the\npoker hands. After producing as many hands from the pocket as you think fit, take the\npack out and ag ain have it shuffled. Return to the platform, drop pack on the face up\npacket as you pick up the easel to show it. Place the easel in position, pick up the cards\nand begin a stud poker deal, faces up on to the stand. Let the cards of each of the four\nhands overlap slightly so that each card is quite visible but cannot get out of order. Dealer\ngets the winning hand.\nThe deal finished drop the rest of the cards into your left outside coat pocket. In this\npocket, on one side of a handkerchief, you have before hand placed the 32 cards of the\npack from which the 20 of set No. 3 was made up. Drop the cards now on the other side\nof the handkerchief. Sweep the cards off the stand in an apparently haphazard way but\nactually begin with hand No. 1 and push against the last card so that the cards slide one\non the other and put the packet face up on your left hand. Pick up No. 2, 3 and 4 in the\nsame way. With them in hand bring out the 32 cards from your left coat pocket which\nmade up the complete pack, leaving the other lot on the other side of the handkerchief.\nYou have thus a complete pack with an arranged stack on the top.\nIf proficient you may false shuffle and have the pack cut, bringing the cards back to the\noriginal set up. Now deal four poker hands in the regular way. Drop the rest of the cards\non the table and announce that you have dealt the four highest possible hands in poker.\nAsk the spectators what these hands are and they will reply, Royal Flush, Straight Flush,\nFour of a Kind and a Full House. You maintain that they are mistaken and in the end you\nprove that the four highest hands in poker are four Royal Flushes. Turn the hands face up\nand show those hands."

    "text": "\"The Perpetual Almanac or Gentleman Soldier's Prayer Book,\" printed in the \"Seven\nDials\" of London two or three centuries ago. This book relates how \"one Richard\nMiddleton was taken bef ore the Mayor of the city he was in for using cards in church\nduring Divine Service; being a droll, merry and humorous account of an odd affair that\nhappened to a private soldier in the 60th Regiment of Foot,\" which, by the way, is known\ntoday as the King' s Royal Rifles. The story reads thus: —\n\"The sergeant commanded his party to the church, and when the parson had ended his\nprayer he took his text, and all of them that had a Bible pulled it out to find the text; but\nthis soldier had neither Bible, Almanac or Common Prayer Book but he put his hand in\nhis pocket and pulled out a pack of cards and spread them before him as he sat; and while\nthe parson was preaching he first kept looking at one card and then at another.\n\"The sergeant of the company saw him, a nd said, 'Richard, put up your cards for this is\nno place for them.' 'Never mind that,' said the soldier, 'you have no business with me\nhere.' Now the parson had ended his sermon and all was over; the soldiers repaired to the\nchurchyard, and the commanding officer gave the word to fall in which they did. The\nsergeant of the city came and took the man prisoner.\n'Man, you are my prisoner,' said he. 'Sir,' said the soldier, what have I done that I am your\nprisoner?' 'You have played a game of cards in the chu rch.' 'No,' said the soldier, 'I have\n363 not played a game, for I only looked at a pack.' 'No matter for that, you are my prisoner.'\n'Where must I go?' said the soldier. 'You must go before the Mayor,' said the sergeant.\n\"So he took him before the Mayor and when they came to the Mayor's house he was at\ndinner. When he had dined he came down to them and said. 'Well, sergeant, what do you\nwant with me?' 'I have brought a soldier before you for playing at cards in church.' 'What,\nthat soldier?' 'Yes,' 'Well, sol dier what have you to say for yourself?' 'Much, sir, I hope.'\n'Well and good, but if you have not you shall be punished the worst that ever man was.'\n\" 'Sir,' said the soldier, 'I have been five weeks upon the march and have had but little to\nsubsist on, and am without either Bible, Almanac or Common Prayer Book, or anything\nbut a pack of cards. I hope to satisfy your Honor of the purity of my intentions.' Then the\nsoldier pulled out of his pocket the pack of cards, which he spread before the Mayor; he\nthen began with the Ace.\n\" 'When I see the Ace,' he said, 'it puts me in mind that there is one God only; when I see\nthe Deuce, it puts me in mind of the Father and Son; when I see the Tray, it puts me in\nmind of the Father, Son and Holy Ghost; When I see th e Four it puts me in mind of the\nfour evangelists that penned the Gospels, viz —Matthew, Mark, Luke and John; when I\nsee the Five it puts me in mind of the five wise virgins who trimmed their lamps —there\nwere ten, but five were foolish and were shut out; wh en I see the Six it puts me in mind\nthat in six days the Lord made Heaven and Earth; when I see the Seven, it puts me in\nmind that on the seventh day God rested from all the works which he had created and\nmade, wherefore the Lord blessed the seventh day an d hallowed it. When I see the Eight\nit puts me in mind of the eight righteous persons that were saved when God drowned the\nworld, viz., Noah, his wife, his three sons and their wives; when I see the Nine it puts me\nin mind of the nine lepers that were clea nsed by our Saviour, there were ten but nine\nnever returned God thanks; when I see the Ten it puts me in mind of the Ten\nCommandments that God gave Moses on Mount Sinai on the two tables of stone.\"\n\"He took the Knave and laid it aside. 'When I see the Que en it puts me in mind of the\nQueen of Sheba who came from the furthermost parts of the world to hear the wisdom of\nKing Solomon, for she was as wise a woman as he was a man, for she brought 50 boys\nand 50 girls all clothed in boys' apparel to show before K ing Solomon for him to tell\nwhich were boys and which were girls; he could not until he called for water for them to\nwash themselves; the girls washed up to their elbows and the boys only up to their wrists,\nso King Solomon told by that; when I see the Kin g it puts me in mind of the great King of\nHeaven and Earth, which is God Almighty, and likewise his Majesty King George to pray\nfor him.'\n\" 'Well,' said the Mayor,' you have a very good description of all the cards except one\nwhich is lacking.' 'Which is that?' said the soldier. 'The Knave,' said the Mayor. 'Oh, I can\ngive your Honor a very good description of that if your Honor won't be angry.' 'No, I will\nnot,' said the Mayor. 'If you will not term me to be the Knave.' 'Well,' said the soldier, 'the\ngreatest Knave I know is the Sergeant of the city that brought me here.' 'I don't know,'\nsaid the Mayor, 'that he is the greatest Knave but I am sure he is the greatest fool.'\n364 'When I count,' added the soldier, 'how many spots there are in a pack of cards I f ind\nthere are 365, there are just so many days in the year. When I count how many cards\nthere are in a pack I find there are 52, there are so many weeks in a year. When I count\nhow many tricks in a pack I find there are 13, there are so many lunar months i n a year.\nYou see, sir, that this pack of cards is a Bible, Almanac, Common Prayer Book and pack\nof cards to me.'\n\"Then the Mayor called for a loaf of bread, a piece of good cheese and a pot of good beer,\nand gave the soldier a piece of money, bidding him go about his business saying he was\nthe cleverest man he had ever seen.\"\nNow you and I, gentle readers, know exactly the useful and comprehensive purpose that\nour soldiers at the front require packs of cards for. Aye, but it is good to be brought\nbefore the Mayor, after he has dined.\nIndispensable Sleights\nCard tricks of any really entertaining value cannot be presented without the aid of a few\nsimple sleights but with them, even a simple trick can be made to look like real magic.\nThe word 'sleight ' has a terrifying effect on most people who like to learn a few tricks,\nand is at once associated with the idea of hours of drudgery practicing intricate\nmovements requiring intense application to master them. However I will guarantee that\nanybody of ordi nary intelligence, with the ability to shuffle a deck of cards by the\noverhand method fairly neatly, can in a couple of hour's time gain a working knowledge\nof the simple sleights that follow and in a very short time he will, by using them, have\nthem liter ally at his fingers' ends. The novice is advised to follow the directions given\nexactly. Later, as the simple principles underlying the various moves become clear, he\nwill experience the fascination of devising his own methods and putting into practice\nvariations and tricks of his own invention.\n1. THE OVERHAND SHUFFLE\nThis is the term applied to the ordinary shuffle in which the cards are passed singly or in\nsmall packets from the right hand to the left, the cards being drawn off by the left thumb.\nIt affords a means of keeping a card or several cards completely under c ontrol without\narousing the least suspicion on the part of the onlookers. In the following exercises turn\nthe top card face up so that you can follow the processes easily.\nA. Take the deck face down in the left hand, holding it at an angle of about 45 deg rees\ntowards the right. Lift the deck with the right hand retaining the top card in the left by a\nslight pressure of the left thumb. Shuffle off all the cards on top of this one. Lift the\nwhole deck with the right hand and shuffle off all the cards into th e left to the last card,\ndropping this on the top. Thus with two perfectly fair shuffles you have the top card back\nin its original position.\nB. With the pack in the left hand lift it with the right but this time press lightly on the\nbottom card with the left fingers, retaining it and at the same time draw off the top card\n366 with the thumb as before. The top cards thus falls on the bottom card in the left hand\nwhile the right hand holds all the rest of the deck. Shuffle these cards freely on top of the\ntwo i n the left hand. The card you are controlling is now second from the bottom and you\ncan turn the pack over and show the bottom is an indifferent one; then turning the cards\nface down lift off and show several cards from the top, also indifferent cards. Shu ffle\nagain, this time retaining the bottom card and lifting all the others with the right hand.\nThe special card will now be the last card of this portion and you have simply to shuffle\nfreely until it alone remains in your hand and you drop it on the top of the pack.\nC. To retain a card at the bottom of the deck you will have already noted that it is merely\nnecessary to retain it in your left hand by pressing on it with the left fingers.\nD. It is very often necessary to place a definite number of cards o n top of another card.\nThis is done by what is termed 'running', and means simply drawing cards off the top of\nthe deck one by one with the left thumb in the course of a shuffle. If the cards are in good\ncondition, and I take it for granted that only such cards will be used by you, a few\nminutes practice will enable you to run off any number of cards in this manner with the\ngreatest of ease.\nE. To make the best use of the overhand shuffle, it must be combined with a very simple\nmove, so simple that I evolved it from my own inner consciousness as a schoolboy only\nto find in later years that it had been used by gamblers as far back as records go . It is\ncalled the jog, that is, a card pulled back a little over the inner end of the deck so that it\nbecomes a marker indicating its own position or that of the card or cards immediately\nbelow it. To apply the idea take a few cards, say the four aces and put them on top of the\npack. Hold the pack in the left hand ready for shuffling and lift the rear half with the right\nhand. In making the first movement of taking the cards off with the left thumb, move the\nright hand about half an inch inwards towards th e body and draw off one card only, then\nmove the right hand forward again and continue the shuffle as usual. At the end of the\nmovement one card will protrude from the deck at the inner end marking the location of\nthe four aces. To bring them back to the t op seize all the cards below the protruding card,\nlift them and drop them on the top just as if you were making a simple cut. You have the\nfour aces back on the top. (See illustration).\nAny number of cards, up to about half the deck can be retained undist urbed by this\nsimple expedient. After the first card has been jogged make the shuffle so that the cards\nfall irregularly and the projection of the jogged card from the rear end of the deck cannot\nbe noticed. I cannot advise the reader too strongly to use t his expedient until it becomes\nsecond nature. The whole action can be done without looking at the hands and while\ncarrying on an animated conversation with your audience.\nF. To retain the whole deck in order.\n368 Take the deck in the left hand as if about t o deal, push off a small packet with the left\nthumb and take them in the right hand. From the bottom of the pack push off a few cards\non top of the right hand packet. Again push a packet off with. the left thumb receiving it\nbelow the cards in the right ha nd, and again with the left fingers push a packet taking it\non top of the right hand packet. Continue in the same way until the whole pack is in the\nright hand. Do not attempt to make the movements quickly, this is the only sleight I know\nof that a rather rough execution rather enhances the effect.\nThe shuffle leaves the pack in the condition of having been cut once. If it is necessary to\nreturn it to its original order from the top card down, spread the faces to show the cards\nare well mixed and cut at th e original bottom card which you noted before beginning."

    "text": "This is the term applied to the shuffle in which the deck is divided into two packets, the\nends put together, the cards being bent upwards and released in such a way that they\nbecome interlaced. To retain a card or a small packet of cards on the top, you have simply\nto release it or them from the right hand portion last of all. If the bottom cards are to be\nretained then they are let fall from the left hand in the first movement o f the shuffle. It\nwill readily be noted that cards can be retained both at the top and the bottom at the same\ntime.\nA false cut\nHold the deck by the sides near the ends between the thumb and second finger of each\nhand. Now pull out about one third of the cards from the bottom and put them on the top\nbut still hold them with the thumb and second finger. With the right third finger lift about\nhalf the lower packet, draw the hands quickly apart releasing the top packet which falls\non the table resuming its o riginal position. On it drop the packet from the left hand, and\non that the right hand packet. The cards are in their original order. (See illustration).\n2. PALMING A CARD.\nContrary to the opinions of most magicians I maintain that palming a card is not a\ndifficult operation. It simply requires confidence and a proper understanding of the right\nmethod. To get the right position hold your right hand palm upwards and on it lay a face\nup card so that the top index corner touches the top joint of the little f inger and the lower\nindex corner presses against the fleshy part at the base of the thumb. Bend the fingers\nnaturally keeping the thumb near the side of the hand and the fingers close together. Now\nturn the hand over. The card will be retained in the hand with ease and as long as you\nkeep the palm towards your body it will be safely hidden. (See illustration).\nNow with a thorough understanding of the way the card is to be held in the hand, the next\nstep is to learn how to get it secretly into that position from the top of the pack.\n369 Take the pack face down in the left hand in position for dealing. Place the right hand over\nit, thumb at the inner end, the first joints of the four fingers resting on and covering the\nouter end of the pack. Run the fingers and thumb of the right hand over the edges and\nends of the cards in the natural way of squaring the pack, and bring them back to the\nsame position with fingers covering the outer ends. Then with the left thumb push the\nlower end of the top card to the right. T he least contraction of the right hand will then\nsecure the card in the exact palming position. Move the fingers and thumb of the right\nhand to the right hand corners of the pack and hold it between the forefinger and thumb\nwhile the left hand squares the sides. Remove the left hand and hold the pack in the right.\n(See illustration).\nIf these actions are followed exactly, the palming of the card will be imperceptible to the\nclosest observer. Later when you put the pack down to be cut, or hand it to be shuf fled by\nsomeone on your extreme left, the action is perfectly regular.\nDo not hold your right hand and arm stiffly as if paralyzed or immediately put it behind\nyour back. Keep our wrist relaxed and natural and forget about the card being in the hand.\nTo get the card back on the pack, hold out your left hand and have the pack placed on it\nand cut by the spectator. Pick up the lower portion with your right hand, adding the\npalmed card to the top, and assemble the pack.\n3. THE SIMPLE PASS\nA card having bee n chosen, cut the pack for its return. Have it replaced on the lower\nportion and replace the cut on top, slipping the tip of your left little finger on the card and\nbetween the two packets. Hold the outer ends of the pack tightly closed and riffle the\nends of the cards a couple of times. Seize the upper portion between the right thumb at\nthe rear and the fingers at the outer ends. Lift it off, and at the same moment drop the left\nthumb under the lower packet and turn it face upwards, and immediately shuffle the cards\nof the right hand packet onto the faces of the lower packet.\nDo not be in a hurry and do not look at your hands. Look at your victim, ask him if he is\nsure he will know his card again and go straight into the shuffle. Turn the pack over and\ncontinue the shuffle. You have the card on the top to do with as you will.\nIt should be sufficient to say that the greatest of present day magicians use this pass only.\n4. THE DOUBLE LIFT.\nMany modern card tricks employ this sleight of lifting two cards as one. It is not difficult,\nthe difficulty lies in making it naturally. With the pack well squared in the left hand face\ndown, bring the right hand over it, thumb at the rear, fingers on the outer end. Make a\nmotion of squaring the ends and at the same time press the fingers back a little making\nthe ends of the deck slightly wedge shaped. With the ball of the thumb lift the rear ends\nof the two top cards and slip the tip of the left little finger under them.\n370 With the right thumb tip on the back of the two c ards and the tip of the right forefinger on\nthe face, turn the two cards as one and lay them face up on top of the pack, the ends\nprotruding over the inner end of the deck for about half an inch. Exhibit the card in this\nposition, name it, and seize the ca rds again at the lower outer corner as before and turn\nthem face down on the back of the pack.\nThe little finger tip should be inserted before attention is called to the card and the turn\nmade naturally and Without hesitation or fumbling. There are many u ses for the sleight,\nfor instance you apparently show the top card and put in the middle, it immediately\nreturns to the top.\n5. THE GLIDE\nHold the pack face up in the left hand between the first joint of the thumb on one side and\nthe second joints of the four fingers on the other. Call attention to the bottom card, say it\nis the 2D. Turn the pack face downwards and with the tip of the left f inger draw the\nbottom card, 2D, back towards the body about 3/4 of an inch. Now with the tip of the\nright hand second finger draw out the next card, say it is the 8H and put it face\ndownwards on the table.\nThe sleight is easy and deceptive. For instance, you may get a chosen card second from\nthe bottom by means of the overhand shuffle as already explained. Show the bottom card,\nturn the pack face down and deal the bottom card face up; draw back the next card by the\nglide and deal cards from above it to a c hosen number - then deal the chosen card face\ndown. Have the card named and turn it up."

    "text": "(from Annemann's \"202 Methods of Forcing\" [available as ebook from Lybrary.com ])\n371 The pack having been shuffled by a spectator, is returned to performer who takes it in\nright hand, at the same time casually pulling up left sleeve followed by the left hand\npulling up right sleeve. When righ t hand with deck pulled up left sleeve, the bottom card\nof deck was easily spotted. Asking the party if they are satisfied, a pass is made and card\nbrought to about two -thirds down in pack. A slight break is held at this spot. The thumb\nof left hand now ru ns the cards of the upper portion, fanwise, over into the right hand, the\nperson being, at the same time, invited to take one. When about half of the upper portion\nhas been passed, a card, NOT THE ONE TO BE FORCED, is pushed temptingly\nforward. The person may be inclined to take it —whether he is so inclined or not, the\nperformer draws it back, with the remark. \"Oh! not necessarily that one.\" This gives him\nconfidence, and the performer continues to pass the cards over to the right hand,\nspreading them nicel y fanwise, until he reaches the one to be forced, which he exposes a\nlittle more than usual, then continues, \"Just take any one you please.\" It will, of course,\nbe understood that the action must be timed, as near as possible, to meet the hand, as it is\nraised to draw a card.\nThe card to be forced is on the bottom of deck. The cards are run from left to right in the\nusual manner, but the action is started while approaching the audience so as to give time\nfor the following maneuvre: With the second and thir d fingers of the left and right hand\nwork the bottom card over toward right side. The cards are still run from left to right\npassing above the chosen card. Ask someone in the audience to indicate his choice by\ntouching the card desired. When it is indicate d lift up this card with all the cards above it\nand as the pack is squared up the forced card slips in from below.\nIn this method a few top cards are prearranged. Three cards of one number (say five) are\nplaced on the top of the deck and the card to be fo rced then placed at eight from the top.\nThe pack is false shuffled, keeping the top eight cards in place. The three top cards are\nthen dealt onto table in a row and one selected while face down. This one is turned over\nand the spectator handed deck to coun t down and remove the fifth card, which is the right\none.\nWhat is known as the \"bridge\" makes possible a neat cutting force. The card is on bottom\nof deck. Cutting same about center, the lower half, which is to be placed on top, is given\na bend (concave) at the ends. Spectator is asked to cut deck somewhere and look at face\ncard of cut. If cut is made at sides, this will work time after time, as the slight break at\nsides will cause upper half to be lifted off by a quick cut. By bending the sides, the bridg e\ncan be placed at ends for an end cut. Previous cutting by the spectator will give you this\ninformation. Most cuts are at sides.\nPlace a short card near center of the deck. Card to be forced mentally is above it. Hold\ndeck straight up in front of spectat or. With first or second right fingers riffle top of deck\nfrom face to back, smoothly and without a stop. Ask spectator to note cards and to think\nof one that he sees. Practice before a mirror to get speed. The short card will click by and\nthe following ca rd will register on the spectator when the rest of the deck is a slow blur.\nDon't try to stop at the card but let it work itself. It will seem impossible at times that a\ncard will show up in this way but try it before several people before you judge.\n372 THE KNIFE METHOD\nIn this method the card to be forced is placed about 15th from the top. Cards are held in\nthe left hand. The little finger makes a break directly underneath the known card. A flat\nknife is handed to spectator who is asked to insert it anywher e he may please. Performer\nslowly riffles the pack. It is only necessary that the knife enter the pack below the chosen\ncard and fairly near to it. The top fifteen cards are now pushed forward onto the blade,\npack being tilted slightly downward. Performer grips the knife with right hand and the\nfifteen cards, the lowest of which is the known card, are pushed well forward and slightly\nraised. The spectator is asked to note this card, which appears to be the one he has cut.\nThe Nikola Card System\nThe last word in Card Conjuring. A development, on astonishing lines, of the principle of\nthe stacked pack, presenting features unbelievable until demonstrated.\nBy this system pre -arrangement seems impossible. The sequence bears close\ninvestigation, and is undete ctable in counting, displaying, repeating, or even in deliberate\nexamination .\nAll that has been done by previous systems can be done with this, and more.\nThe most valuable feature of the system is that the pack can actually be stacked during\nthe performa nce, which may be entirely impromptu, and given at a moment's notice with\na borrowed pack of cards.\nA complete description of the system, including pictorial chart, with detailed instructions\nfor tricks in conjunction, and valuable subsidiary devices and artifices applicable to this\nand general purposes of conjuring with cards follows."

There is method in the madness.\nEvery fourth card being the heart suit permits of an all -trump hand being dealt for whist\nor bridge.\n\nOn the same deal every second card forms one of a sequence complete as to values but\nregardless of suits, for the presentation of an elaboration of the tr ick known as \"The\nSpelling Bee.\" (For the reason that a king is not available, in consequence of more\npressing demands, a knave has to do duty for such, as will be explained in its proper\nplace.)\nThe first twenty -one cards are studiously placed for the pu rpose of a \"game of Poker\" - to\nthe advantage of the dealer.\n375 The remaining cards have no special significance. The complete arrangement is not even\narbitrary: once the principle has been grasped it may be revised to meet individual\nrequirements or fancy, or for partial disguise.\nThis is the basis of the system, and the rotation of the cards, with their numerical\nequivalents, must be memorized until as familiar as the alphabet. This, of course, presents\na greater immediate difficulty than the \"eight kings threatened to save\" achievement, but\neven so, and purely by an effort of concentration, it is not an insuperable task.\nFortunately, however, there is a system of mnemonics by the aid of which it can be made\na mental fixture much more quickly and with grea ter certainty than without. This is\noutlined in the next section."

When this has been done, shuffle thoroughly - and repeat\nagain until it can be done without hesitation. The exercise may be alternated by questions\nas to the numerical position of specified cards, and by naming cards at numbers chosen at\nrandom.\nIn case the process has not already been made quite clear, we will take two more\nexamples -\nQuestion. What is the eighteenth card? Eighteen is 1 -ch - latch:\nthe Waitress is fastening the Latch: Waitress represents the Queen of Clubs. Answer. -\nThe Queen of Clubs.\nQuestion. At what number is the King of Hearts? The King of Hearts is a Bridegroom: he\nis waiting in the Lobby, Lobby (1 - b) is 1& Answer. - Sixteenth.\nWe may profitably conclude the section by an analysis of the arrangement. If the pack is\nstacked and then dealt into four, the heaps will be as follows: -\nTABLE 5. (For reference only.)\n\nNotes on TABLE 5.\nThe second and fourth hands are available for special purposes - the fourth for play as\nunder, the second for the \"Spelling Bee\" trick. Five of D. Three of D. Queen of D. Eight of H. Three of S. Eight of C. Ten of D. Six of H. Two of S. Seven of D. Queen of S. Three of H. Ten of S. Ace of D. Jack of C. Four of H. Ace of S. Jack of S. Four of C.

Jack of D. King of D. King of H. Three of C. Ten of C. King of S. Ace of H. Five of S. Nine of D. Nine of S. Queen of H. Six of D. Five of C. King of C. Jack of H.\n380 The first and third may be named in order by repeating the sequence with the omission of\nthe intermediate cards.\nWHIST or BRIDGE: — The fourth hand contains the whole of the heart suit. The\nperformer may either deal it to himself and let it go at that, or he may invite the spectators\nto \"choose\" a heap, and force this one upon them. Or, he may trust to luck and accept it i f\nthe choice falls upon it. The suit for trumps may be forced by inviting a player to cut for\ntrumps from this heap. If the choice falls upon the second heap he may instead give the\n\"Spelling Bee\" trick. If upon either of the other two he offers to tell th e chooser what\ncards he holds. In either case there is nothing to prevent a further choice being offered.\nSPELLING BEE: — The cards as dealt face down, of course, are in the correct order for\nthis. The performer takes up the cards and spells - o.n.e, one. At each letter he transfers a\ncard from top to bottom of the packet, and on the word \"one\" turns up the ace and lays it\non the table. T.w.o, two, is spelled out in the same way, and so on throughout the packet\nto the end of the story. No king can be provid ed, as three have been appropriated to the\npoker hands, so the Knave of Spades has been made to do duty for the king. It is very\nsimilar, and if shown quickly it will pass.\nPOKER: — The first twenty cards of the pack, dealt as poker hands, are rather artfu lly\ndisposed.\nThe first player gets a sequence, - 2. 3. 4. 6. 6.\nThe second gets - 6. 9. 10. J. Q.\nThis is one card short of a sequence, and if he exercises his option of 'buying' a card his\nenterprise is rewarded. He gets the eight of diamonds (the twe nty-first card) and then\nholds - 8. 9. 10. J. Q. The third hand gets a \"full house\" - K. K. K. 9. 9.\nSuch a combination of hands in a real game of poker might give rise to some little\nexcitement. Whatever the speculative proclivities of the players, the w izard can stand\nfirm to the last in the triumphant possession of a royal flush - A. K. Q. J. 10, (all hearts.)\n\"NAP.\"\nThe same hands will ensure the happy security to the dealer.\nFinally, Table 6 is given from which to refresh the memory from time to ti me. The\nmemory tags, once acquired, can easily be recalled, and an occasional reading of the table\n(if it should fall into disuse) should be sufficient to revive the impressions.\nTABLE 6.

I'll do it again to sho w you it\nwasn't an accident. Stop? These are (so many.)\" (Count and verify.)\nPROCEDURE: — The cards are held in the left hand as for dealing. The right thumb rests\nagainst the lower end, and the right forefinger riffles. When stopped, the right hand lifts\noff the upper packet of cards at the break and turns it face up. A glance at t his card, and a\nreference to its number indicates the number of cards in the packet. For instance, if\nstopped on the eight of spades, twenty -nine cards are in the packet. If the face card of the\npacket is the ten of hearts there are twenty cards. In counti ng the cards, of course, proper\ncare must be used not to displace the order.\nA variation may be effected by cutting any number of cards demanded. To do this, riffle\nslowly and stop at the card bearing the equivalent Code number. For instance, if thirty\ncards are asked for, riffle to the six of spades: if thirty -nine, riffle to the Jack of Clubs,\nand so on.\n2. CARDS BY WEIGHT.\n\"Perhaps you think I count the cards. I won't say that I don't but I need not.\"\n\"Will you cut, please, at any point you like. Jus t by weighing these cards in my hand I\ncan tell you that you have cut exactly (so many) cards. Of course, it's easy to tell you that.\nI'll count them or perhaps you would not believe me. .... Correct.\"\nIn this case the procedure is varied. Presumably the spectator who cuts the cards will\ndeposit the packet face down on the performer's palm, and to turn it over might be\nconspicuous. Directing public attention unconsciously towards it by a gesture of careful\nconsideration of its weight, he tilts the left -hand packet with the left thumb, and with the\nleft-hand finger tips pushes the top card slightly over the edge of the packet until the\nindex is just readable. Say this is the four of clubs, which is the thirty -fifth card, then\nthere are thirty -four cards in t he right hand packet.\n3. WEIGHING CHOSEN CARDS\n\"Will somebody take a card, please. Don't let me see what it is.\" \"It hardly seems credible\nthat the difference in the printing of the faces of the cards - the colour of the ink and the\ndifference in quantit y for the different spots and designs would make a perceptible\ndifference in the weight; but perhaps I can distinguish it. 'Perhaps not,' you may retort,\nbut let me try. Lay that card face down on the palm of my hand, please. ..... That is the\ntwo of clubs . See.\"\n\"No. I didn't guess it. I'll do it again. Will you take one, please. I can recommend any of\nthese. Lay it on my hand as before...... That is the eight of clubs.\"\nPROCEDURE: — The cards are spread fan -wise in offering a choice. When a card is\nremov ed the performer retains the break with the little finger of the left hand in closing\n383 up the pack, and immediately after makes a secret cut, (\"The Pass\" or \"The Shift\") or if\nnot proficient in sleight -of-hand, boldly lifts the cards above the break and put s them at\nthe bottom. He then tilts the pack with the left thumb, and sights the bottom card. The\nchosen card is the card next in order in the sequence. Thus, in the first instance the\nbottom card is the eight of diamonds (21,) and the chosen card is the t wo of clubs (22;)\nand in the second instance the indicating card is the three of spades (45,) and the chosen\ncard is the eight of clubs (46.)\n4. THE SENSE OF TOUCH\n\"Another card, please. Don't let me see it. Look at it intently, and remember it well. The n,\ninstead of laying upon my hand, lay it on the palm of your own face down. Just for three\nseconds. One - two -three. Good. Now replace it in the pack. It will not be required any\nfurther. Allow me, please, to place the palm of my hand upon yours. The car d leaves an\nimpression behind which can be felt by the super -sensibility of my highly trained touch.\nIt feels like a picture card - a diamond - the King of Diamonds.\"\nPROCEDURE: — When the card is removed the performer retains the break as before,\nbut he d oes not cut the cards. When offering the pack for the card to be returned, he\ndivides it at the break, so that the card is replaced in the same position. He also lifts the\nupper half of the pack in such a way as to enable him to sight the bottom card of th at half,\nin this case the Jack of Diamonds (14,) and thereby becomes acquainted with the fact that\nthe King of Diamonds (15) has been chosen.\n5. LOCATING\n\"Again take a card, please. Look at it, remember it, and return it to the pack. Then I will\nshuffle. Will you please cut ....... You chose the four of clubs, and it is the forty -sixth\ncard, counting from the top.\"\nThis is accomplished by calculation. First the chosen card is ascertained by means\nalready made use of - viz, a break is held at the point wh ere the card is removed, and in\nopening the pack to have the card replaced at the same point, the card above is sighted. In\nthis case it is supposed that the Jack of Spades (34) is sighted, therefore the four of clubs\n(35) is the chosen card. It is replace d, and the pack plainly squared up. The shuffle is\nfalse. The cut, or any number of cuts, is genuine. Now to find the position of the chosen\ncard, note the bottom card, (say the two of spades, 41): if, as in this example, the code\nnumber of the bottom card is higher than the code number of the chosen card, subtract the\ncode number of bottom cards from 52, and add the number of the chosen card to the\nresult - thus, - 52 - 41 = 11. 11 + 35 = 46. and the four of clubs will be found at that\nnumber.\nIf the code number of bottom card be lower than that of the chosen card, it is only\nnecessary to subtract the former from the latter. For example, - Chosen card = ten of\ndiamonds (47,) bottom card+ nine of clubs (19,) 47 - 19 = 28, and the twenty -eighth card\nwill be found to be the ten of diamonds.\n384 If the performer prefers digital to mental activity, he may adopt a different procedure.\nThis is to make a secret cut below the eight of hearts (the normal bottom card of the\nsequence) to restore the pack to its regular st arting point. No calculation is then\nnecessary, it only being necessary to name the numerical equivalent of the ascertained\nchosen card.\nTo facilitate the restoration of the pack on occasion, it is necessary that the top or bottom\ncard should be prepared as what I have chosen to term a \"pilot\" card. This card may be\ncut short as explained in Chap. 17.\nOr a plan recommended is to bend up the bottom left hand corner of the top card (the six\nof diamonds) and work it between the thumb and finger until it is s oft. Only a small\nextent is necessary, say to within an eighth -of-an-inch or so of the edge. When the cards\nare riffled with the right thumb across this corner, the cards will \"break\" above the six of\ndiamonds, and the point can be cheeked by a quick glimp se of the eight of hearts.\nIncreased pressure of the thumb will bend up the upper half of the pack slightly to permit\nthe insertion of the little finger of the left hand, and a secret cut will transpose the two\nhalves of the pack.\n6. SPELLING\n\"Sometimes I can find cards by spelling them. For instance, - K.I.N.G, S.P.A.D.E.S., and\nI get the King of Spades. T.E.N.H.E.A.R.T.S., and I get the Ten of Hearts.\nS.I.X.S.P.A.D.E.S., and I get the Six of Spades.\"\nPROCEDURE: — This is perfectly straightforward and au tomatic. It is only necessary to\nstart with the eight of hearts at the bottom. As each letter is spelled, an accompanying\ncard is taken from the top of the pack, and placed at the bottom. After the letter S of the\nfirst spelling, the King of Spades turns u p, and after sh owing it is replaced on the top.\nThis is the only point to remember. The ten of hearts is then spelled out, and transferred\nto the bottom. The six of spades follows. If the six of spades be replaced on top, the Jack\nof Clubs can be spelled o ut. Transfer the Jack of Clubs to the bottom and spell out the six\nof diamonds (including the word \"of\" in the spelling) and the original starting point will\nbe reached.\n7. TO SPELL ANY CARD CALLED FOR\nIf the experimenter cares to go to the trouble he ma y elaborate the last feat to the extent\nof inviting the audience to name any card and spell it out in the same way.\nTo do this, make a rapid calculation of the number of letters in the description of the card,\ni. e. - start with the value, add five for clubs, six for hearts or spades, and eight for\ndiamonds. Subtract the sum from the tabulated number of the card and tra nspose the pack\nto bring to the top the card which is the numerical equivalent of the result.\nThus, if the seven of clubs is called for\n385 5+ 5 = 10.\nSeven of clubs = 25.\n25 - 10 = 15.\nCard No. 15. = King of Diamonds.\nThe King of Diamonds being cut to t he top, the seven of clubs is the eleventh card down,\nthe desired position for revelation by spelling.\nAnother example, -\nRequired, the eight of diamonds.\n5+ 8 = 13.\nEight of diamonds = 21.\n21 - 13 = 8.\n8 = Queen of Hearts.\nCut the Queen of Hearts t o the top of the pack, and the thirteen cuds required for spelling\nare on top of the eight of diamonds.\nIn the event of the number of letters in the name of the card being greater than the code\nnumber of the card, subtract the number of letters from 52 an d add the code number to\nobtain the indicator.\nTo divide the pack at the right point to bring the card desired to the top, sight the card\npreceding by riming the left hand bottom corner of the pack with the right thumb. This is\nnot difficult as the sequen ce is a guide to the approximate position. When the card is\nsighted, the little finger of the left hand is inserted, and a secret cut made. If the reader\ncannot execute a secret cut he may make an open cut. Better than either, the false riffle\nshuffle (See Chapter 19), necessitates the pack being divided into two packets as a\npreliminary, and it is a perfect cover to the artifice of the break to make it openly in this\nconnection, while the \"shuffle\" itself can be so executed as to leave the pack cut or inta ct\nat will.\n8. THOUGHT ANTICIPATED\n\"Now will somebody just think of a card. Do you mind? Think of just any card you like,\nbut don't think of more than one card, and once having made a choice, don't change it, but\nthink of it exclusively and intently. And will somebody else please think of a number —\na number between one and fifty -two.\n386 \"Now, sir, what card did you think of? The Jack of Clubs. And what number did you\nthink of? Twenty -four. Very well. Now listen attentively, please. I have not handled these\ncards at all. They have been out of my hands while the card and the number have been\nmentally chosen. My object has been, not merely to divine your thoughts but to anticipate\nthem; and if my effort has been successful the Jack of Clubs will be found twent y-fourth\nin the pack.\"\nPROCEDURE: — Here is an application of \"system\" to an older effect whereby a more\ncomplete realization of the idea is obtainable than by the elementary process usually\nassociated with it.\nRule 1: — If the specified number be lower th an the table number of the chosen card, the\ndifference must be transferred from top to bottom Therefore, subtract the required\nnumber from the table number of the card, and take the remainder as the indicator of the\ncard to be sighted, and cut to the botto m of the pack.\nEXAMPLE: — Required to place the Jack of Spades fifteenth 34 - 15 = 19 = nine of\nclubs. Cut the nine of clubs to the bottom, and the Jack of Spades becomes the fifteenth\ncard.\nRule 2: — If the specified number be higher than the table number of the chosen card, the\ndifference must be transferred from the bottom to the top. Therefore, subtract the table\nnumber of the card from the required number, and subtract the remainder from 52. This\ngives the indicator of the card to be sighted and cut to the bottom of the pack.\nEXAMPLE: — Required to place the four of diamonds twenty -seventh. 27 - 13 = 14.\n52 - 14 = 38 = Ace of diamonds.\nCut the ace of diamonds to the bottom of the pack, and the four of diamonds becomes\ntwenty -seventh.\nRule 3: — (Applic able to either case.) This general rule may, if preferred, take the place\nof both the preceding rules.\nDeduct the required number of appearance from 52, and add the table number of given\ncard. When the sum exceeds 52, deduct 52.\nEXAMPLES: — Required to place the Jack of Spades fifteenth.\n52 - 15 = 37.\n37+ 34 = 71 - 52 = 19 = Nine of clubs, which cut to bottom of pack.\nRequired to place the Four of Diamonds twenty -seventh.\n387 52 - 27 = 25.\n25+ 13 = 38 = Ace of Diamonds, which cut to bottom of pack.\nFor the double purpose of emphasizing the effect and facilitating the procedure, the pack\nat the outset is laid upon the table. After the two participants have been invited to \"think,\"\nthe performer pauses for a period of masterly inact ivity. Then he asks for the card and the\nnumber, upon receipt of which he makes the necessary calculation as quickly as possible:\nhe also makes a mental estimate of the approximate position of the card to be cut to the\nbottom of the pack. Deliberately reac hing for the pack he, in process of lifting it, first\nturns it upon its edge, the backs of the cards towards the spectators. With the thumb he\npushes a portion of the pack from left to right in such a way as to reveal the indices round\nabout the required c ard. The location is completed in gathering up the pack, and the little\nfinger inserted at the break. The few subsequent remarks are framed to give time to make\nthe secret cut. This is a case where technique should be faultless. If the reader will turn\nback a moment to the performer's remarks, he will note that the audience is invited to\n\"listen\" and not to \"watch,\" and with experience in control he should be able to divert\nattention from his hands to his face for just so long as may be necessary.\n9. UNCON SCIOUS THOUGHT TRANSMISSION\n\"I will give you an astonishing example of the effect of unconscious thought\ntransmission. Will somebody take any one card, please —but don't look at it.\n\"I will at once place it, without looking at it myself, face down in this envelope. I will\nseal the envelope and place it in sight and out of reach —here. None of you, nor I, know\nwhat card is in that envelope.\n\"Next I will invite you to name any card, but so that there shall be no suspicion of\ncollusion, let it be a joint sele ction. First name a suit . . . Diamonds. Will you have a court\ncard or a spot card. ... A spot card: very well, how many spots shall we say? Eight!\n\"The choice, then, falls on the eight of diamonds, and I think you will admit, under the\nconditions, it cou ld not have been prearranged. It is a strange thing —I would not believe\nit myself, if I hadn't done it — the eight of diamonds is the identical card in that envelope\nover there.\"\nThe envelope used is preferably of a large size —5 1/4 in. x 4 1/2 in. and is prepared by\nneatly slitting the bottom to a little more than the length of a playing card.\nWhen a card is taken, a secret cut is made at the point where it is removed. The pack is\nretained in the left hand, back upwards, and the envelope is casually laid on top of the\npack, and grasped in the same hand. The right hand receives the chosen card and pushes\nit, face down, into the envelope. It is pushed through the slit in the bottom to the extent of\nabout a quarter of an inch, and in this position is gripped in the fork of the thumb against\nthe top of the pack. When the envelope is withdrawn the card remains behind on the top\n388 of the pack, and it is an empty envelope that is erected for the contemplation of an\nexpectant audience. Upon the front of this envelope is stuck a minute pellet of wax, or\ndiachylon.\nWhile a card is being named in stages, the performer holds the pack in front of him edge\nup, with the faces to the right and the backs to the left, grasped in both hands in such a\nway that it is completely c overed. The thumb of the right hand supports the bottom end,\nand the four fingers of the same hand cover the opposite end. The side of the pack nearest\nthe spectators rests upon the second, third and fourth fingers of the left hand, the thumb\nof the same h and rests upon the opposite side (nearest the performer) and the first finger,\nbent, rests upon the top. The upper cor ners can therefore easily be riffl ed by a slight\naction of the left thumb, and as soon as the required card is known it is sighted (using the\nsequence as a guide) and a break made above it. It is secretly cut to the top of the pack\nand in due course the envelope is laid over it while it is ripped open with a knife. The cut\nis made along the edge already partially severed, and the evidence of faking thereby\ndestroyed. Meanwhile the top card of the pack is pressed against the pellet of wax, and\nwhen it has been secured to the envelope, the pa ck is placed aside, and the fingers\ninserted into the envelope. The concealed card is drawn up behind as though coming\nfrom the interior of the envelope.\n10. WIZARD'S WHIST\n\"I will give you an example of the practical application of thought -reading to ca rdplaying. It is useful sometimes to know what card your opponent thinks of playing.\"\n\"Will you please suppose you had these cards in your hand at the card table, and decide\nupon one of them to play. You need not necessarily choose the highest or a good card,\nbut just think of any one, for the purpose of a test. Only one, please, and don't forget it.\nKeep it in mind for a little while.\n\"Will you do the same, please. Think of one of these. And you. Thank you.\"\n\"Who else will take a hand? You? Thank you.\n\"Remember the one card in each case, forget the others, and return them all to me.\n\"For the purpose of illustration we will imagine the game is whist, so I will deal the cards\naccordingly.\n\"Now, as I sh ow you the hands, tell me if you see your particula r card amongst them.\n\"You thought of the .................... you have in mind the ..........., you are going to play the\n................., and you decided upon the . ... . \"\n389 PROCEDURE: — This is entirely independent of the system, and can be done withou t\nany prearrangement of cards; but it is introduced here because it happens to make a very\nappropriate conjunction of effects.\nEach of the four spectators taking part is given four cards from the top of the pack. They\nare taken back in the same order as t hey were given out, and replaced at the bottom of the\npack. A false shuffle may be introduced here, but the cards must be left intact at the\nbottom of the pack. Four whist hands are then dealt, and the process of the deal will\ndistribute the sixteen bottom cards of the pack to the tops of the four heaps and divide\neach original group of four cards among the same. So that directly the information is\nobtained that a chosen card is in a particular heap, as it can only be one card of that heap,\nit is easily dis covered. The group of four cards last returned to the pack are the top cards\nof the newly dealt hands, and when the last \"player\" points out the heap that contains the\ncard he thought of, it must be the top card. The four cards next returned are the second\ncards of the whist hands, and the second card of the hand that contains the thought of card\nis it. And so on with the other two groups. It is essential to remember that the cards first\nreturned to the pack are fourth after the deal, the second to be retur ned are third after the\ndeal, the third the second, and the fourth the last.\nWhen performing this trick with an unprepared pack it is necessary for the performer\neither to look at the faces of the cards, or secretly glimpse the indices. With the\nprearranged pack this is unnecessary as he can name the cards by mental reference to th e\nCode.\nHe cannot, with the prepared pack, shew the fourth hand without prematurely exposing\nthe fact that it contains all of one suit, but this is not only unnecessary, but the omission\nadds somewhat to the effect. Any card or cards not revealed in the f irst three heaps must\nnecessarily be in the fourth, and knowing this and being acquainted with the contents of\nthe heap he can name them without any reference to it.\n11. ALL TRUMPS\n\"Now, gentlemen, if you please, we will play the hands out. Will you cut for trumps?\n\"Hearts. . . Then I think the game is mine!\"\nPROCEDURE: — This has already been explained, —see page 386. While astonishment\nover the last effect is still fresh, and the victims are not in a condition to notice the\nirregularity of the proceedin g, the performer picks up his own and offers it for the cut.\nThe other hands are pushed across to the would -be players, and after due interval they are\nconfronted with the constellation of trumps.\nSo far is a smooth -working, rational sequence of effects. It may be extended or varied at\ndiscretion. The possibilities are not yet exhausted.\n390 12. THE SPELLING BEE. 13. THE GAME OF POKER, and 14. THE GAME OF\n\"NAP\" have already been referred to.

All that is necessary is to note the bottom card, and\nfollow the code while counting the cards behind the back until the required one is\nreached. If the pack has been disarranged it forms a suitable opportunity for an exchange\nof packs.\n17. TO PRODUCE CARDS CALLED FOR FROM THE POCKET\nThis, a feat usually achieved by the use of a duplicate pack sorted into the divisions of\ncard holders, can be done with the stack ed deck.\nCut the six of diamonds to the top, and divide the pack into four equal parts by riming\nand sighting the indices. The first packet is cut at the thirteenth card, and four of\ndiamonds, and placed in the left breast pocket; the second is cut at the twenty -sixth card,\nthe four of spades, and placed in the right trousers pocket; the third is cut at the thirty -\nninth card, the Jack of Clubs, and placed in the left trouser pocket; and the remaining\nthirteen cards are put in the right breast pocket. The b acks of the cards in each case are\noutwards.\nWhen a card is called for, mentally refer to its Code number, from which it is clear which\npack it is in: plunge both hands alternately into various pockets, and with the hand most\nconvenient to the one contain ing the required card, count in accordance with the Code\nuntil it is reached, and bring it out of the pocket, tog ether with all above it, and sho w as\none, then return to the pocket. In this way the order of the cards is undisturbed.\nFor instance, the King of Spades is wanted. King of Spades is the eleventh card, and\ntherefore in the first division, and in the left -hand breast pocket. The right hand counts\nthe cards, in this case conveniently backwards - thirteen, twelve, eleven: the thumb\nseparates twelve from eleven and the rest, and these are gripped with thumb at one end,\nsecond and third fingers at the other end, and the first and fourth fingers one on each side,\nso that the cards are neatly and securely squared up.\nAgain. The three of hearts is asked for. This is the forty -fourth card, and therefore in the\nfourth heap and in the right -hand breast pocket. Count from the top —forty, forty -one,\nforty -two, forty -three, forty -four, and grip the five cards in the same way.\nThe six of clubs would be thirty -one — in the left -hand trousers pocket. The left hand\ncounts, twenty -seven, twenty -eight, twenty -nine, thirty, thirty -one, and sho ws as before.\nAt the conclusion, the packets are removed from the pockets in the reverse order to their\ninsertion, and stacked one above the other to restore the order.\n391 18. A SUBTLE GAME\nAlthough the system is made use of in this trick, it is not necessary for the pack to be pre -\narranged. To begin with it is therefore handed out for thorough shuffling. Prior to so\ndoing, however , the performer abstracts, and palms, any four cards in Code order. For\nconvenience we will assume the cards to be the four bottom cards of the stack —\nThree of Diamonds.\nFive of Diamonds.\nQueen of Diamonds.\nEight of Hearts.\nAfter the pack has been shu ffled to satisfaction, the palmed cards are returned to the top\nand subsequently forced upon four spectators.\nThe four cards are returned and manipulated to the top of the pack by any of the usual\nprocesses. A false shuffle of any type that retains the fo ur top cards is given. The cards\nare then dealt into four hands and one given to each of the four people who chose cards.\nThey are distributed in order so that each gets the hand containing his own card, and in\ngathering up, it is desirable to displace the bottom, so that the chosen card is not\nconspicuous.\nThe parties are then instructed to sort their hands into suits, as for a game, and to hand the\nperformer such cards as he calls for. On this amiable understanding, he proceeds to name\nthe cards according to the Code backwards from the next in order to the four forced\ncards. In the present example therefore he will first call for the six of hearts, then the ten\nof diamonds, next the eight of clubs, and so on. As the cards are handed to him he places\nthem naturally, face down, in the left hand. This he contin ues until one card only remains\nin each person's hand, that card being the one originally chosen. The spectator's are left\nwith their chosen cards, and the wily wizard is left with —!\nI promised my reader that I should show him how to arrange the pack in f ull view of the\naudience, and I have now redeemed my promise. I have done more than I promised. He\nhas not even had the trouble of arranging the pack. It is done, and the audience has done\nit for him, lured into the belief that they are assisting a trick. The four isolated cards are\ntaken in their proper order and added to the stack to complete the chain. If you can beat\nthat for audacity —next please!\nThis properly precedes the other tricks in order of execution, but I have kept it till the\nlast, partly so that it might come as a surprise and partly because familiarity with the\nmaterial was necessary, both for its appreciation and for its performance.\n392 It may be used or not, by way of introduction, as circumstances demand, or, commencing\nwith a previously a rranged pack, it may be held in reserve against an accidental or\nantagonistic disarrangement."
